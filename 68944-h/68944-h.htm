<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Lost on the Orinoco</span>” is a complete tale in
itself, but forms the first volume of the “Pan-American
Series,” a line of books intended to embrace
sight seeing and adventures in different portions of
the three Americas, especially such portions as lie
outside of the United States.</p>

<p>The writing of this series has been in the author’s
mind for several years, for it seemed to him that
here were many fields but little known and yet well
worthy the attention of young people, and especially
young men who in business matters may have to
look beyond our own States for their opportunities.
The great Pan-American Exhibition at Buffalo,
N. Y. did much to open the eyes of many regarding
Central and South America, but this exposition,
large as it was, did not tell a hundredth part of the
story. As one gentleman having a Venezuelan exhibit
there expressed it: “To show up Venezuela
properly, we should have to bring half of the Republic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[iv]</span>
here.” And what is true of Venezuela is
true of all the other countries.</p>

<p>In this story are related the sight seeing and adventures
of five wide-awake American lads who
visit Venezuela in company with their academy professor,
a teacher who had in former years been a
great traveler and hunter. The party sail from
New York to La Guayra, visit Caracas, the capital,
Macuto, the fashionable seaside resort, and other
points of interest near by; then journey westward
to the Gulf of Maracaibo and the immense lake of
the same name; and at last find themselves on the
waters of the mighty Orinoco, the second largest
stream in South America, a body of water which
maintains a width of three miles at a distance of over
600 miles from the ocean. Coffee and cocoa plantations
are visited, as well as the wonderful gold and
silver mines and the great <i>llanos</i>, or prairies, and the
boys find time hanging anything but heavy on their
hands. Occasionally they get into a difficulty of
more or less importance, but in the end all goes well.</p>

<p>In the preparation of the historical portions of this
book the very latest American, British and Spanish
authorities have been consulted. Concerning the
coffee, mining and other industries most of the information<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">[v]</span>
has come from those directly interested
in these branches. This being so, it is hoped that the
work will be found accurate and reliable as well as
interesting.</p>

<p>Once more thanking the thousands who have read
my previous books for the interest they have shown,
I place this volume in their hands trusting it will
fulfil their every expectation.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />

<small>THE BOYS TALK IT OVER</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Hurrah</span>, Mark, it’s settled at last.”</p>

<p>“What is settled, Frank?”</p>

<p>“We are to go to Venezuela and other places in
South America. My father just got the word from
Professor Strong. I brought the letter along for
you to read.”</p>

<p>“That’s certainly immense news,” remarked
Mark Robertson, as he took the letter which Frank
Newton held out to him. “Does he say how soon
he will be able to start?”</p>

<p>“Just as soon as he can settle up affairs at Lakeview
Academy. I suppose he’s got quite something
to do there yet. But we can hurry him along, can’t
we?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you’ll hurry the professor much,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
answered Mark, as he began to read the communication
which had been passed to him. “He’s one of
the kind that is slow but sure—not but that he can
move quick enough, when you least expect it.”</p>

<p>“As for instance on the night we tried to hide all
the schoolbooks in the old boathouse,” responded
Frank, with a twinkle in his eye. “He caught us
neatly, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“That’s what. Hullo! So Beans and Darry are
going, too. I like that first rate. Beans is all right,
even if he is from Boston, and Darry will furnish
fun enough for a minstrel show.”</p>

<p>“To be sure. I wouldn’t want to go if they
weren’t along, and you. But do you see what the
professor says on the last page? He wants to take
Jake the Glum along too.”</p>

<p>At this the face of Mark Robinson fell somewhat.
“I wish he had left Glummy out,” he said. “He
knows the fellow is sour to the last degree and a
bully in the bargain.”</p>

<p>“I guess the professor wants to reform him,
Mark.”</p>

<p>“He’ll have up-hill work doing it. Glummy has
been at the academy two years and I know him
pretty thoroughly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>“Well, he’ll be the richest boy in the crowd. Perhaps
that had something to do with taking him
along.”</p>

<p>“No, the professor doesn’t think so much of
money as that. Each person in the crowd will have
to pay his share of the expenses and his share of the
professor’s salary, and that’s all, outside of the incidentals.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if the incidentals won’t be rather
high.”</p>

<p>“I fancy we can make them as high as we please—buying
souvenirs and things like that. You can
be sure Glummy will try his best to cut a wide swath
if he gets the chance.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the professor will hold him in. But
it’s great news, isn’t it?” And in his enthusiasm
Frank began to dance an impromptu jig on the
library floor.</p>

<p>Frank Newton was a New York city youth, sixteen
years of age, tall, well-built and rather good
looking. He was the only son of a Wall Street
banker, and if his parent was not a millionaire he was
exceedingly well to do. The lad resided in the fashionable
part of Madison Avenue when at home,
which was not often, for his family were fond of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
going abroad, and either took the boy with them or
sent him to boarding school.</p>

<p>Directly opposite the home of the Newtons lived
the Robertson family, consisting of Mr. and Mrs.
Robertson, Mark, and several smaller children. Mr.
Robertson was a dry goods importer who owned an
interest in several mills in England and Scotland,
and he made trips across the Atlantic semi-yearly.</p>

<p>Although Mark Robertson was a year older than
Frank Newton, the two lads were warm friends and
had gone to school together for years. Their earlier
education had been had in the city, but when Frank
was eleven and Mark twelve both had been packed
off to Lakeview Academy, a small but well conducted
school nestling among the hills of New
Hampshire.</p>

<p>Five years of life at the academy had made the
place seem like a second home to the boys. The
master, Professor Amos Strong, was a thorough
gentleman and scholar, and under his guidance the
boys progressed rapidly in all their studies. The
professor had in his day been both a traveler and
hunter, and the stories he was wont to relate during
off hours were fascinating to the last degree.</p>

<p>As might be expected, the boys, while at school,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
made many friends and also an enemy or two, although
as regards the latter, the enmity was never
very deep, for Professor Strong would not tolerate
anything underhanded or sneakish.</p>

<p>Next to Mark, Frank’s dearest chum at the
academy was Dartworth Crane, a slightly built boy
of fifteen, who was as full of fun as a boy can well
be. Dartworth, or “Darry” as he was always called
for short, was the son of a rich Chicago cattle dealer,
and the boy’s earlier days had been spent on a ranch
in Montana. He loved to race on horseback and
hunt and fish, and the master sometimes had all he
could do to hold the sunny but impetuous lad within
proper bounds.</p>

<p>As Frank had another chum, so did Mark, in the
person of Samuel Winthrop, the son of a well-to-do
widow who resided in the Back Bay district of Boston.
Samuel was a tall, studious looking individual,
with a high forehead and a thick mass of curly black
hair. Because he came from Boston, he had been
nick-named “Beans,” and although he did not relish
the <i>sobriquet</i> it was likely to stick to him for years
to come.</p>

<p>Among the lads to join those at the academy two
years before had been Jacob Hockley, a thin, lank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
youth of Mark’s age, with a white freckled face
and hair strongly inclined to be red. Hockley was
the only son and heir of a millionaire lumber dealer
of Pennsylvania. His manner was peculiar, at times
exceedingly “bossy” as the others declared, and
then again morose and sour, the latter mood having
won for him the nickname of “Glummy” or “Jake
the Glum.” Hockley was given to spending his
money, of which he had more than was good for
him, freely, but even this had failed to make him any
substantial friends.</p>

<p>The enmity between Hockley on one side, and
Frank and Mark on the other, had arisen over the
captaincy of the academy baseball team the summer
previous. Jake wished to be the captain of the team,
and had done his best to persuade or buy the boys
over to vote for him. But Frank had advocated
Mark for the captaincy, and Mark had won, much
to the lank youth’s discomfiture.</p>

<p>“You’ll never win a game with Mark Robertson
as captain and with Frank Newton on first-base,”
had been Jake’s sour comment, but he was sadly
mistaken. That summer the team played nine games
with the teams from rival schools, and won seven of
the contests. The winning made Jake Hockley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
more down on Mark and Frank than ever, but as the
others were popular he had often to conceal his
real feelings.</p>

<p>On a windy night in June the cry of “fire!” had
aroused every inmate of Lakeview Academy from his
bed, and had caused all to leave the rambling building
in a hurry. The conflagration had started in the
laundry, and from this room quickly communicated
to the kitchen, dining hall, and then the remainder
of the stone and wood structure. In such a high
wind, the fire department from the village, two miles
away, could do little or nothing, and the efforts of
the students, headed by the several teachers, were
likewise of no avail. Inside of three hours everything
was swept away and only a cellar full of
blackened debris marked the spot where the picturesque
academy had once stood.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances many a man would
have been too stunned to act immediately, but ere
the stones of the building were cold, Professor
Strong was laying his plans with the insurance companies
for the erection of a new and better structure.
The students were cared for at some neighboring
houses and then refitted with clothing and sent home.</p>

<p>During the fall there had been much talk of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
personally conducted tour to South America during
the coming year, the tour to be under the guidance
of Professor Strong, who had been South a number
of times before. Letters had been sent to the parents
of various students, but nothing definite had been
done up to the time the fire occurred.</p>

<p>Mark and Frank had planned for the trip South,
and could not bear to think of giving it up, and as
soon as Professor Strong was in a position to give
them his attention, Frank had gotten his father to
write concerning it. Several letters passed, and at
last Professor Strong decided to leave the building
and the management of the new academy to his
brother, who had just left the faculty of Harvard,
and go with the boys.</p>

<p>While the trip was being talked of at the academy,
previous to the fire, Jake Hockley had announced
his determination to go, but since the boys had separated,
nothing more had been heard from the lank
youth, and Mark and Frank were hoping he had
given the plan up. The announcement therefore,
that he would make one of the party, put a damper
on their enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“He’ll get us into some kind of trouble before we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
get back, you see if he doesn’t,” was Frank’s comment.</p>

<p>“I’ll make him keep his distance,” was Mark’s
reply. “If he attempts to go too far I’ll show him
that I won’t stand any nonsense.”</p>

<p>The party of six were to leave for Venezuela by
way of New York city, and a few days after the conversation
just recorded Sam Winthrop came down
on the train from Boston, to remain with Mark until
the arrival of the professor.</p>

<p>“Beans, by all that’s delightful!” cried Mark, as
he wrung his friend’s hand. “So glad you came a
few days ahead.”</p>

<p>“I wanted a chance to look around New York,”
answered Sam Winthrop. “I’ve never had a chance
before, you know.”</p>

<p>“You shall look around, all you please, and Frank
and I will go with you.”</p>

<p>“Is Darry here yet?”</p>

<p>“No, but Frank expects him to-morrow. Then
we can all go around until Professor Strong arrives.
But say, what do you think about Glummy going?”
and Mark looked anxious.</p>

<p>“Can’t say that I am overjoyed, Mark.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>“I wish it was anybody but Hockley—and Frank
wishes the same.”</p>

<p>“Well, all arrangements have been made, so we’ll
have to make the best of it. But I heard one thing
that doesn’t please me,” went on Sam. “I got a
letter from Dick Mason, and in it he said Glummy
was talking of the trip to some of his chums, and
said he was going just to show Frank and you a
thing or two.”</p>

<p>“Did he? I wonder what he meant?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t mean anything very good, you can
be sure of that, Mark.”</p>

<p>“You are right. We’ll certainly have to keep our
eyes open and watch him,” concluded Mark, seriously.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />

<small>PREPARING FOR THE START</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the following morning Darry Crane came in,
on the Limited Express direct from Chicago. He
sent a telegram ahead, to Frank, who went up to
the Grand Central depot to meet his chum.</p>

<p>“Had a fine trip,” said Darry, “but, honest, I
couldn’t get here fast enough, I’ve been that anxious
to see you. Heard from Beans yet? I’ll wager he
comes down with his grip loaded with beans, on
account of the long trip, you know. What, didn’t
bring any beans? Must be a mistake about that.”</p>

<p>“I guess he was afraid you’d forget the pork,”
answered Frank, with a laugh. “But how have you
been since you left school?”</p>

<p>“First-class. Went West, you know, with my
father and nearly rode a pony to death on the Lone
Star ranch. Oh, it was glorious to get over the
ground. Beats a stuffy old city all to bits. Hold
on, I’ve got to look after my trunk. Wouldn’t want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
to lose that, for it’s got the whole outfit for the trip
in it.”</p>

<p>“Our man will have the trunk brought to our
house,” answered Frank. “You come with me, and
I’ll take you down to Mark’s, where you’ll find
Beans. By the way, heard anything of Glummy?”</p>

<p>“Did I? Well, I just guess, Frank. What do you
think? He actually paid me a visit—not very long,
of course, but still he came to see me. Said he was
passing through Chicago on a trip to St. Louis, and
felt that he had to hunt up an old chum. I almost
fainted when he said it. But he acted quite decent,
I must admit, not a bit airish or sour either.”</p>

<p>“Did he say anything about this trip to South
America?”</p>

<p>“Not much, excepting that he would like to go
if it went through. I didn’t say much either, for
I was thinking you and Mark wouldn’t like to have
him along. You don’t, do you?”</p>

<p>“Not much, although I guess we can stand it
if he lets us alone. We needn’t have much to do
with him.”</p>

<p>Taking Darry’s valise from him, Frank led the
way to the street and hailed a passing auto-cab, and
both were speedily taken to the home on Madison<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
Avenue. A few minutes later they hurried across
the way and joined Mark and Sam.</p>

<p>In anticipation of the good times ahead, all four
of the lads were in a happy frame of mind, and the
remainder of the day was spent by the New Yorkers
in showing the visitors around Central Park and
other points of interest. In the afternoon the four
went downtown and crossed the Brooklyn Bridge.
Then they came back to the Battery and took the
little craft which plies hourly between that point and
Bedloe’s Island, where is located the Statue of
Liberty, standing as a gigantic sentinel to New York
Bay.</p>

<p>“How big it looks when one is close to it,” remarked
Sam, when they disembarked close to the
base of the statue. “I thought climbing to the top
would be easy, but I fancy it’s going to be as tedious
as climbing to the top of Bunker Hill monument.”</p>

<p>And so it proved, as they went up the dark and
narrow circular steps leading to the crown of the
statue. They wished to go up into the torch, but
the way was blocked owing to repairs.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mark, on looking around him, uttered
an exclamation of surprise. “Glummy Hockley!
How did you get here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>His words caused the others to forget their sight
seeing for the moment, and they faced about, to find
themselves confronted by the freckled-faced youth,
who had been gazing in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>“I’ll thank you not to call me ‘Glummy,’” said
Hockley, coolly, although he too was taken by surprise.
Then he turned to Darry. “How do you
do, Darry? When did you arrive?”</p>

<p>Mark bit his lip and looked at Frank, who gave
him a knowing look in return. Clearly it had been
an ill beginning to the conversation. Somehow
Mark felt as if he had not done just right.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Glum—I mean Hockley, I’ll try to
remember your proper name after this,” he stammered.</p>

<p>“I don’t mind those things at school, but you
must remember we are not at school now,” went on
Hockley, with something of an air of importance.
Then he smiled faintly at Sam. “How are you,
Beans?”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, but we are not at school now, and
my name’s not ‘Beans,’” was the dry response.</p>

<p>There was a second of silence, and then Darry
burst into a roar of laughter, and Frank and Mark
were compelled to follow, the whole thing seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
so comical. Hockley grew red, but when Sam
joined in the merriment he felt compelled to smile
himself, although he looked more sour than ever
directly afterward.</p>

<p>“All right, Sam, I’ll try to remember,” he said
with an effort, and held out his hand.</p>

<p>The two shook hands and then the lank youth
shook hands with Darry. After this there was nothing
to do but for Frank and Mark to take Hockley’s
hand also, and this they did, although stiffly.</p>

<p>But the ice was broken and soon all were talking
as a crowd of boys usually do. Hockley had
brought a field glass with him and insisted on all
using it.</p>

<p>“Bought it down in Maiden Lane this morning,”
he remarked. “Got the address of a first-class firm
from a friend who knows all about such things. It
cost me sixty-five dollars, but I reckon it’s worth it.
Ain’t many better glasses around. I expect it will
be just the thing in Venezuela.”</p>

<p>“No doubt,” said Darry, but felt somewhat disgusted
over Hockley’s air of importance. Nevertheless,
the glass was a fine one, and everybody enjoyed
looking through it. Ships coming up the
Lower Bay could be seen at a long distance, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
they could also see over Brooklyn and Long Island,
and over Jersey City and Newark to the Orange
Mountains.</p>

<p>“What are you fellows going to do to-night?”
questioned Hockley, when they were going down
the stairs again.</p>

<p>“We thought something of going to Manhattan
Beach to see the fireworks——” began Frank, and
broke off short.</p>

<p>“I was thinking of going to Coney Island,” went
on the lank youth. “Supposing we all go there?
I’ll foot the bill.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t care to go to Coney Island, and I
don’t think Darry and Sam will care either,” said
Mark.</p>

<p>“Let us all go to Manhattan,” broke in Sam.
“I’ve often heard of the fireworks.” He had not
the heart to give Hockley too much of a cold
shoulder.</p>

<p>So it was arranged, on the way back to the Battery,
and then there was nothing to do but ask the
lank youth to dine with them.</p>

<p>“We are bound to have Glummy on us, sooner or
later,” whispered Mark to Frank, while they were
eating. “Perhaps it’s just as well to make the best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
of it. It will be time enough to turn on him when
he does something which is openly offensive.”</p>

<p>When it came time to settle the bill, the lank
youth wished to pay for everybody, but the others
would not allow this.</p>

<p>“Let everybody pay for himself,” said Darry.
“Then there won’t be any trouble.”</p>

<p>“I can pay as well as not,” said Hockley, sourly.</p>

<p>“So can any of us,” returned Mark, dryly; and
there the subject dropped.</p>

<p>The trip to Manhattan Beach and the fireworks
were very enjoyable, and before the evening came
to an end everybody was in a much better humor,
although both Mark and Frank felt that they would
have enjoyed the trip more had Hockley not been
present.</p>

<p>Hockley was stopping at the Astor House, and
left them near the entrance to the Brooklyn Bridge.
He had wanted them to have a late supper with him,
and had even mentioned wine, but all had declined,
stating they were tired and wished to go to bed.</p>

<p>“He must be getting to be a regular high-flyer if
he uses much wine,” remarked Frank when the four
were on their way uptown. “What a fool he is
with his money. He thinks that covers everything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>“He’ll be foolish to take to drink,” returned
Darry. “It has ruined many a rich young fellow,
and he ought to know it.”</p>

<p>“I think Hockley would be all right if it wasn’t
for the high opinion he has of himself,” came from
Sam. “But his patronizing way of talking is what
irritates. He considers nobody as important as himself.
In one way I think he’d be better off if he was
poor.”</p>

<p>“The family haven’t been rich very long—only
eight or ten years, so I’ve heard,” said Mark. “Poor
Hockley isn’t used to it yet. It will be a lesson to
him to learn that there are lots of other rich folks
in this world who aren’t making any fuss and
feathers about it.”</p>

<p>In the morning came a message from Professor
Strong, stating that he had arrived, and was stopping
at the Hotel Manhattan. He added that he would
see Mr. Robertson and Mr. Newton that morning,
and would be at the service of the boys directly after
lunch.</p>

<p>“Now we won’t lose much more time,” cried
Frank. “I declare I wish we were to sail for Venezuela
to-day.”</p>

<p>“I fancy the professor has a good many arrangements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
to make,” said Sam. “It’s quite a trip we are
contemplating, remember.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! it’s not such a trip to Caracas,” returned
Darry. “My father was down there once—looking
at a coffee plantation.”</p>

<p>“A trip to Caracas wouldn’t be so much, Darry,”
said Mark. “But you must remember that we are
going further,—to the great lake of Maracaibo, and
then around to the mouth of the Orinoco, and hundreds
of miles up that immense stream. They tell
me that the upper end of the Orinoco is as yet practically
unexplored.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! we’ll become the Young Explorers!”
cried Darry, enthusiastically. “Say, I wonder if
the professor will want us to go armed?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” said Frank. “He’ll go armed,
and as he is a crack shot I guess that will do for the
lot of us.”</p>

<p>“Glummy showed me a pearl-handled pistol he
had just bought,” put in Sam. “He said it cost
him sixteen dollars.”</p>

<p>“He’d be sure to mention the price,” said Frank,
with a sickly grin. “I’d like to see him face some
wild beast—I’ll wager he’d drop his pistol and run
for his life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>“Maybe somebody else would run, too,” came
from Mark. “I don’t believe it’s much fun to stand
up in front of a big wild animal.”</p>

<p>“Are there any such in Venezuela?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know—we’ll have to ask the professor.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />

<small>ON BOARD THE STEAMER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the boys presented themselves at Professor
Strong’s room at the Hotel Manhattan they
found that worthy man looking over a number of
purchases he had made while on his trip downtown.</p>

<p>“Glad to see you, boys,” he said, as he shook one
and another by the hand. “I trust you are all feeling
well.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t been sick a minute this summer,” answered
Darry, and the others said about the same.</p>

<p>“I see you have your firearms with you,” remarked
Mark, as he gazed at a rifle and a double-barreled
shotgun standing in a corner. “We were
wondering if we were to go armed.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t feel at home without my guns,” returned
the professor with a smile. “You see that
comes from being a confirmed old hunter. I don’t
anticipate any use for them except when I go hunting.
As for your going armed, I have already arranged
with your parents about that. I shall take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
a shotgun for each, also a pistol, for use when we are
in the wilds of the upper Orinoco.”</p>

<p>“Will you lead us on a regular hunt?” asked
Darry, eagerly.</p>

<p>“I will if you’ll promise to behave and not get
into unnecessary difficulties.”</p>

<p>“We’ll promise,” came from all.</p>

<p>“I have been making a number of purchases,”
continued Professor Strong. “But I must make a
number more, and if you wish you can go along
and help me make the selections.”</p>

<p>“Is Glummy—I mean is Jake Hockley coming up
here?” questioned Mark.</p>

<p>“I expected him to come with you. Isn’t he stopping
with one of you?”</p>

<p>“No, he’s stopping at the Astor House,” came
from Frank.</p>

<p>There was an awkward pause, which was very
suggestive, and the professor noted it. With his
gun in hand he faced the four.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you do not care much to have Master
Hockley along,” he said, slowly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I reckon we can get along,” answered
Darry, after the others had failed to speak.</p>

<p>“It is unfortunate that you are not all the best of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
friends. But Hockley asked me about the trip a
long while ago and when it came to the point I
could not see how I could refuse him. Besides that,
I was thinking that perhaps the trip would do him
good. I trust you will treat him fairly.”</p>

<p>“Of course we’ll do that,” said Mark, slowly.</p>

<p>“I guess there won’t be any trouble,” said Frank,
but deep in his heart he feared otherwise.</p>

<p>“Hockley has not had the benefits of much traveling,”
continued the professor. “And traveling
broadens the mind. The trip will do us all good.”</p>

<p>They were soon on their way to Fourteenth
Street, and then Broadway, and at several stores
the professor purchased the articles he had put down
on his list. The boys all helped to carry these back
to the hotel. On arriving they found Jake Hockley
sitting in the reception room awaiting them.</p>

<p>The face of the lank youth fell when he saw that
they had been out on a tour without him. “I’d been
up earlier if you had sent me word,” he said to the
professor. “I suppose I’ve got to get a lot of things
myself, haven’t I?”</p>

<p>“You have your clothing, haven’t you?—I mean
the list I sent to you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>“Then you are all right, for I have the other
things.”</p>

<p>From the professor the boys learned that the
steamer for La Guayra, the nearest seaport to Caracas,
the capital of Venezuela, would sail three days
later.</p>

<p>“There is a sailing every ten days,” said Professor
Strong. “The steamers are not as large as
those which cross the Atlantic but they are almost
as comfortable, and I have seen to it that we shall
have the best of the staterooms. The trip will take
just a week, unless we encounter a severe storm
which drives us back.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to meet a storm,” said Hockley.</p>

<p>“Afraid of getting seasick,” came from Frank.</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” snapped the lank youth. “Perhaps
you’ll get seasick yourself.”</p>

<p>“Does this steamer belong to the only line running
to Venezuela?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>“This is the only regular passenger line. There
are other lines, carrying all sorts of freight, which
run at irregular intervals, and then there are sailing
vessels which often stop there in going up or down
the coast.”</p>

<p>The three days to follow passed swiftly, for at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
last moment the professor and the boys found plenty
of things to do. On the day when the steamer was
to sail, Sam’s mother came down from Boston to
see her son off, and the parents of Mark and Frank
were also on hand, so that there was quite a family
gathering. The baggage was already aboard, a
trunk and a traveling case for each, as well as a
leather bag for the guns and ammunition.</p>

<p>At last came the familiar cry, “All ashore that’s
going!” and the last farewells were said. A few
minutes later the gang-plank was withdrawn and the
lines unloosened. As the big steamer began to
move, something like a lump arose in Frank’s
throat.</p>

<p>“We’re off!” he whispered to Mark. “Guess
it’s going to be a long time before we get back.”</p>

<p>Mark did not answer, for he was busy waving his
handkerchief to his folks. Frank turned to Sam
and saw that the tears were standing in the latter’s
eyes, for Sam had caught sight of his mother in the
act of wiping her eyes. Even Darry and Hockley
were unusually sober.</p>

<p>In quarter of an hour, however, the strain was
over, and then the boys gave themselves up to the
contemplation of the scene before them. Swiftly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
the steamer was plying her way between the ferry-boats
and craft that crowded the stream. Soon the
Battery was passed and the Statue of Liberty, and
the tall buildings of the great metropolis began to
fade away in the blue haze of the distance. The
course was through the Narrows to the Lower Bay
and then straight past Sandy Hook Light into the
broad and sparkling Atlantic.</p>

<p>“Take a good look at the light and the highlands
below,” said the professor, as he sat beside the boys
at the rail. “That’s the last bit of United States
territory you’ll see for a long while to come—unless
you catch sight of Porto Rico, which is doubtful.”</p>

<p>“Won’t we stand in to shore when we round Cape
Hatteras?” asked Hockley.</p>

<p>“We shall not have to round Cape Hatteras,
Hockley. Instead of hugging the eastern shore of
the United States the steamer will sail almost due
South for the Mona Passage on the west of Porto
Rico. This will bring us into the Caribbean Sea,
and then we shall sail somewhat westward for a
brief stop at Curaçao, a Dutch island north of the
coast of Venezuela. It is not a large place, but one
of considerable importance. The submarine cable
from Cuba to Venezuela has a station there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>“I’m going to study the map of Venezuela,” said
Mark. “I know something about it already, but
not nearly as much as I’d like to.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow I’ll show you a large map of the
country, which I have brought along,” answered
Professor Strong. “And I’ll give you a little talk
on the history of the people. But to-day you had
better spend your time in making yourselves at
home on the ship.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to look at the engine room,” said
Frank, who was interested in machinery, and down
he went, accompanied by Darry. It was a beautiful
sight, to see the triple expansion engines working
so swiftly and yet so noiselessly, but it was frightfully
hot below decks, and they did not remain as
long as they had anticipated.</p>

<p>They were now out of sight of land, and the long
swells of the Atlantic caused the steamer to roll not
a little. They found Sam huddled in a corner of the
deck, looking as pale as a sheet.</p>

<p>“Hullo, what’s up?” queried Frank, although he
knew perfectly well.</p>

<p>“Nothing’s up,” was the reply, given with an
effort. “But I guess there will be something up
soon,” and then Sam rushed off to his stateroom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
and that was the last seen of him for that
day.</p>

<p>Mark was also slightly seasick, and thought best
to lie down. Hockley was strolling the deck in deep
contempt of those who had been taken ill.</p>

<p>“I can’t see why anybody should get sick,” he
sneered. “I’m sure there’s nothing to get sick
about.”</p>

<p>“Don’t crow, Glum—I mean Jake,” said Frank.
“Your turn may come next.”</p>

<p>“Me? I won’t get sick.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you five dollars I don’t get sick,” insisted
the lank youth.</p>

<p>“We’re not betting to-day,” put in Darry. “I
hope you don’t get sick, but—I wouldn’t be too sure
about it.” And he and Frank walked away.</p>

<p>“What an awful blower he is,” said Frank, when
they were out of hearing. “As if a person could
help being sick if the beastly thing got around to
him. I must confess I don’t feel very well myself.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” answered Darry, more soberly than
ever.</p>

<p>Dinner was served in the dining saloon at six
o’clock, as elaborate a repast as at any leading hotel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
But though the first-class passengers numbered forty
only a dozen came to the table. Of the boys only
Frank and Hockley were present, and it must be confessed
that Frank’s appetite was very poor. Hockley
appeared to be in the best of spirits and ate heartily.</p>

<p>“This is usually the case,” said the professor,
after having seen to it that the others were as comfortable
as circumstances permitted. “But it won’t
last, and that is a comfort. Hockley, if I were you,
I would not eat too heartily.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it won’t hurt me,” was the off-hand answer.
“The salt air just suits me. I never felt better in
my life.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear it, and trust it keeps on doing
you good.”</p>

<p>Frank and Mark had a stateroom together and so
had Sam and Darry. Hockley had stipulated that
he have a stateroom to himself, and this had been
provided. The professor occupied a room with a
Dutch merchant bound for Curaçao, a jolly, good-natured
gentleman, who was soon on good terms
with all of the party.</p>

<p>There was but little sleep for any of the boys during
the earlier part of the night, for a stiff breeze
was blowing and the steamer rolled worse than ever.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
But by three o’clock in the morning the wind went
down and the sea seemed to grow easier, and all fell
into a light slumber, from which Mark was the first
to awaken.</p>

<p>“I feel better, although pretty weak,” he said,
with an attempt at a smile. “How is it with you,
Frank?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t catch it very badly.”</p>

<p>“Did Glummy get sick?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“He’s in luck. How he will crow over us.”</p>

<p>“If he starts to crow we’ll shut him up,” answered
Frank, firmly.</p>

<p>They were soon dressed and into the stateroom
occupied by Sam and Darry.</p>

<p>“Thanks, I’m myself again,” said Darry. “And
why shouldn’t I be? I’m so clean inside I feel fairly
polished. I can tell you, there’s nothing like a good
dose of <i>mal de mer</i>, as the French call it, to turn one
inside out.”</p>

<p>“And how are you, Beans?” asked Mark.</p>

<p>“I think I’m all here, but I’m not sure,” came
from Sam. “But isn’t it a shame we should all be
sick and Hockley should escape?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>“Oh, he’s so thick-skinned the disease can’t strike
through,” returned Frank.</p>

<p>He had scarcely uttered the words when Darry,
who had stepped out into the gangway between the
staterooms came back with a peculiar smile on his
face.</p>

<p>“He’s got ’em,” he said.</p>

<p>“He? Who? What has he got?” asked the
others in a breath.</p>

<p>“Glummy. He’s seasick, and he’s in his room
doing more groaning than a Scotch bagpipe. Come
and listen. But don’t make any noise.”</p>

<p>Silently the quartet tiptoed their way out of the
stateroom and to the door of the apartment occupied
by Hockley. For a second there was silence. Then
came a turning of a body on a berth and a prolonged
groan of misery.</p>

<p>“Oh, why did I come out here,” came from Hockley.
“Oh dear, my head! Everything’s going round
and round! Oh, if only this old tub would stop rolling
for a minute—just a minute!” And then came
another series of groans, followed by sounds which
suggested that poor Hockley was about as sick as a
boy can well be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“Let’s give him a cheer, just to brace him up,”
suggested Frank, in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Just the thing,” came from Darry. “My, but
won’t it make him boiling mad!”</p>

<p>But Mark interposed. “No, don’t do it, fellows,
he feels bad enough already. Come on and leave
him alone,” and this advice was followed and they
went on deck. Here they met the professor, who
wanted to know if they had seen Hockley.</p>

<p>“No, sir, but we heard him,” said Sam. “He’s
in a bad way, and perhaps he’d like to see you.”</p>

<p>At this Professor Strong’s face became a study.
Clearly he knew what was in the boys’ minds, but
he did not betray it. Yet he had to smile when he
was by himself. He went to see Hockley, and he
did not re-appear on deck until two hours later.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>VENEZUELA, PAST AND PRESENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Supposing</span> we now look at that map of Venezuela
and learn a little about the history of the
country,” said Professor Strong, immediately after
the lunch hour and when all was quiet on board the
steamer. “We can get in a corner of the cabin, and
I don’t think anybody will disturb us.”</p>

<p>Ordinarily the boys would not have taken to
anything in the shape of a lecture, but they were
anxious to know something more of the locality
they were to visit, and so all readily agreed to follow
Professor Strong to the nook he had selected. Hockley
was still absent, and the others asked no questions
concerning him. The professor hung up his
map and sat on a chair before it, and the lads drew
up camp chairs in a semi-circle before him.</p>

<p>“As you will see by the map, Venezuela lies on
the north coast of South America,” began Professor
Strong. “It is bounded on the north by the Caribbean
Sea, on the east by British Guiana, on the south<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
by Brazil and on the west by Colombia. It is irregular
in shape, and its greatest length is from
south-east to north-west, about twelve hundred
miles, or by comparison, about the distance from
Maine to Minnesota or California to Kansas.”</p>

<p>“Phew! that’s larger than I thought,” came from
Frank, in an undertone.</p>

<p>“Many of the South American republics are
larger than most people realize,” went on the professor.
“Venezuela has an estimated area of nearly
598,000 miles—to give it in round figures.
That is as large as all of the New England States
and half a dozen other States combined. The
country has over a thousand rivers, large and small,
over two hundred of which flow into the Caribbean
Sea, and four hundred helping to swell the size of
the mighty Orinoco, which, as you already know,
is the second largest river in South America,—the
largest being the Amazon of Brazil. The Orinoco
is a worthy rival of our own Mississippi, and I am
afraid you will find it just as muddy and full of
snags and bars.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, we’ll get through somehow,” put
in Darry, and his dry way of saying it made even
the professor laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>“Besides the rivers, there are a number of lakes
and bays. Of the former, the largest is Lake Maracaibo,
with an area of 2,100 square miles.”</p>

<p>“That must be the Maracaibo coffee district,”
suggested Mark.</p>

<p>“To a large extent it is, for the lake is surrounded
by coffee and cocoa plantations. In the interior is
another body of water, Lake Valencia, which possesses
the peculiarity of being elevated nearly 1,700
feet above the ocean level. All told, the country is
well watered and consequently vegetation is abundant.”</p>

<p>“But I thought it was filled up with mountains?”
came from Sam.</p>

<p>“A large part of the country is mountainous, as
you can see by the map, but there are also immense
plains, commonly called <i>llanos</i>. The great Andes
chain strikes Venezuela on the west and here divides
into two sections, one running northward toward
the Caribbean Sea and the other to the north-eastward.
Some parts of these chains are very high,
and at a point about a hundred miles south of Lake
Maracaibo there are two peaks which are each over
15,000 feet high and are perpetually covered with
snow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>“I guess we won’t climb them,” observed
Sam.</p>

<p>“I hardly think so myself, Samuel, although we
may get a good view of them from a distance, when
we visit Lake Maracaibo. Besides these chains of
mountains there are others to the southward, and
here the wilderness is so complete that it has not yet
been thoroughly explored. It is a land full of mountain
torrents, and one of these, after flowing through
many plains and valleys, unites the Orinoco with the
Amazon, although the watercourse is not fit for navigation
by even fair sized boats.”</p>

<p>“What about the people?” asked Mark, after a
long pause, during which all of them examined the
map more closely, and the professor pointed out La
Guayra, Caracas, and a dozen or more other places
of importance.</p>

<p>“The people are of Spanish, Indian and mixed
blood, with a fair sprinkling of Americans and
Europeans. There has been no accurate census
taken for a number of years, but the population is
put down as over two and three quarters millions
and of this number about three hundred thousand
are Indians.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>“Are those Indians like our own?” questioned
Darry.</p>

<p>“A great deal like the Indians of the old south-west,
excepting that they are much more peaceful.
You can travel almost anywhere in Venezuela, and
if you mind your own business it is rarely that an
Indian or a negro will molest you. And now let
me ask if any of you know what the name Venezuela
means?”</p>

<p>“I don’t,” said Frank, and the others shook their
heads.</p>

<p>“The name Venezuela means Little Venice. The
north shore was discovered by Columbus in 1498.
One year later a Castilian knight named Ojeda
came westward, accompanied by Amerigo Vespucci,
and the pair with their four ships sailed from the
mouth of the Orinoco to the Isthmus of Panama.
They also explored part of Lake Maracaibo, and
when Vespucci saw the natives floating around in
their canoes it reminded him of Venice in Italy, with
its canals and gondolas, and he named the country
Little Venice, or Venezuela. When Vespucci got
home he wrote an elaborate account of his voyage,
and this so pleased those in authority they immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
called the entire country America, in his honor,
and America it has been ever since.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it ought to be called Columbia,” put
in Frank, as the professor paused.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right, Newton, but it’s too late
to change it now. The Spaniards made the first
settlement in Venezuela in 1520, and the country
remained true to Spain until 1811. Ojeda was first
made governor of all the north coast of South
America, which soon took the name of the Spanish
Main. Pearls were found in the Gulf of Paria, and
the Spaniards at Santo Domingo rushed into South
America and treated the innocent natives with the
utmost cruelty. This brought on a fierce war lasting
over forty years. This was in the times of Charles
V, and he once sold the entire country to the Velsers
of Augsburg, who treated the poor natives even
worse than they had been treated by the Spaniards.
In the end, between the fighting and the earthquakes
which followed, the natives were either killed off or
driven into the interior. Then came another Castilian
knight, who in 1567 founded the city of Caracas,
so called after the Indians who used to live
there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>“I have often read stories of the Spanish Main,”
said Mark. “They must have been bloody times.”</p>

<p>“They were, for piracy and general lawlessness
were on every hand. The Spaniards ruled the people
with a rod of iron, and everything that the country
produced in the way of wealth went into the
pockets of the rulers. At last the natives could stand
it no longer, and a revolution took place, under the
leadership of Simon Bolivar, and a ten years’ war
followed, and the Spanish soldiery was forced to
leave the country.</p>

<p>“At first Venezuela, with New Granada, (now
Colombia) and Ecuador formed the Republic of
Colombia. Simon Bolivar, often called the George
Washington of South America, was the President
of the Republic. At Bolivar’s death Venezuela became
independent, and has remained independent
ever since. Slavery was abolished there in 1854.”</p>

<p>“They were ahead of us in that,” observed Frank.</p>

<p>“So they were, and the credit is due to Jose Gregorio
Monagas, who suffered a martyr’s death in
consequence. The freeing of the slaves threw the
country into another revolution, and matters were
not settled until 1870, when Antonio Guzman Blanco<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
came into power and ruled until 1889. After this
followed another series of outbreaks, one political
leader trying to push another out of office, and this
has hurt trade a good deal. At present General
Castro is President of Venezuela, but there is no
telling how long his enemies will allow him to retain
that office.”</p>

<p>“I hope we don’t get mixed up in any of their
revolutions,” said Sam.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t mind it,” put in Darry. “Anything
for excitement, you know.”</p>

<p>“Venezuela has been divided into many different
states and territories at different times,” continued
Professor Strong. “In 1854 there were thirteen
provinces which were soon after increased to twenty-one.
In 1863 the Federalists conquered the Unionists,
and the provinces were re-named states and reduced
to seven. But this could not last, for fewer
states meant fewer office holders, so the number was
increased to twenty states, three territories and one
federal district. What the present government will
do toward making divisions there is no telling.”</p>

<p>“I should think they would get tired of this continual
fighting,” said Darry.</p>

<p>“The peons, or common people, do get very tired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
of it, but they cannot stop the ambitions of the political
leaders, who have the entire soldiery under
their thumb. These leaders have seen so much of
fighting, and heard of so much fighting in their sister
republics, that it seems to get in their blood and they
can’t settle down for more than a few years at a
time. But as outsiders come in, with capital, and
develop the country, I think conditions will change,
and soon South America will be as stable as North
America or Europe.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />

<small>HOCKLEY MAKES A BOSOM FRIEND</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Now</span> I feel as if I knew a little more than I did
before,” observed Frank to Mark, after the professor’s
talk had come to an end and the teacher had
gone to put away his map. “It’s a pretty big country,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It is, Frank, and at the best I suppose we can
see only a small portion of it. But it would be
queer if we got mixed up in any of their fighting,
wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Do you really think we shall?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. But just before we left New
York I saw a long article in one of the newspapers
about affairs in Venezuela, Colombia and on the
Isthmus. It seems that the Presidents of the two
Republics are unfriendly, and as a consequence the
President of Venezuela has given aid to the rebels in
Colombia, while the President of Colombia is doing
what he can to foment trouble in Venezuela. Besides
that Nicaragua and Ecuador are in the mix-up.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
The papers said that fighting has been going on
in some places for years and that thousands of lives
have been lost, especially in the vicinity of the
Isthmus.”</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder the professor didn’t speak of this.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess he didn’t want to scare us. Perhaps
the soldiery doesn’t interfere with foreigners, if, as
he says, the foreigners mind their own business.”</p>

<p>The day was all that one could wish and the boys
enjoyed it fully, for the seasickness of the day before
had done each good. Mark and his chums
wondered how Hockley was faring, and at last Sam
went to the professor to inquire.</p>

<p>“He is a very sick young man,” said Professor
Strong. “His over-eating has much to do with it.
But I hope to see him better in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he would like to see any of us?”
asked Sam. “We’ll go willingly if you think best.”</p>

<p>“No, he said he wished to see no one but myself,
Winthrop. You will do best to let him alone, and
when he comes out I wouldn’t say anything about
the affair,” concluded the professor.</p>

<p>To while away the time the boys went over the
steamer from end to end, and an obliging under-officer
explained the engines, the steering gear and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
other things of interest to them. So the time passed
swiftly enough until it was again the hour to retire.</p>

<p>Hockley appeared about ten o’clock on the following
morning, thinner than ever and with big
rings under his eyes. He declined to eat any
breakfast and was content to sit by himself in a
corner on deck.</p>

<p>“I suppose you fellows think I was seasick,” he
said, as Sam and Darry passed close to him. “But
if you do, you are mistaken. I ate something that
didn’t agree with me and that threw me into a regular
fit of biliousness. I get them every six months
or so, you know.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know,” returned Darry, who had
never seen Hockley sick in his life. “But I’m
glad you are over it,” he went on, kindly.</p>

<p>“I suppose Frank and Mark are laughing in
their sleeves at me,” went on the lank youth, with
a scowl.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe they are thinking of it,” answered
Sam. “We’ve been inspecting the ship
from top to bottom and stem to stern, and that has
kept us busy. You ought to go around, it’s really
very interesting.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! I’ve been through ’em loads of times—on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
the regular Atlantic liners,—twice as big as this,”
grumbled Hockley.</p>

<p>A few words more followed, and Sam and Darry
passed on. “He’s all right again,” observed Darry.
“And his seasickness didn’t cure him of his bragging
either.”</p>

<p>The steamer was now getting well down toward
the Mona Passage, and on the day following land
was sighted in the distance, a series of somewhat
barren rocks. A heavy wind was blowing.</p>

<p>“Now we are going to pass through the monkey,”
said Darry, after a talk with the professor.</p>

<p>“Pass through the monkey?” repeated Frank.
“Is this another of your little jokes, Darry?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. Mona means monkey, so the professor
told me.”</p>

<p>“Will we stop?”</p>

<p>“No, we won’t go anywhere near land. The
next steamer stops, I believe, but not this one.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind spending some time in Porto
Rico and Cuba,” put in Mark. “There must have
been great excitement during the war with Spain.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we’ll stop there on our way home,”
said Sam. “I should like to visit Havana.”</p>

<p>The Mona Passage, or Strait, passed, the course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
of the steamer was changed to the south-westward.
They were now in the Caribbean Sea, but the waters
looked very much as they had on the bosom of the
Atlantic. The wind increased until the blow promised
to be an unusually severe one.</p>

<p>“My, but this wind is a corker!” ejaculated
Frank, as he and Mark tried in vain to walk the
open deck. “Perhaps we are going to have a hurricane.”</p>

<p>“You boys had better come inside,” said Professor
Strong as he hurried up. “It’s not safe to
be here. A sudden lurch of the steamer might hurl
you overboard.”</p>

<p>“All right, we’ll come in,” said Mark.</p>

<p>He had scarcely spoken when an extra puff of
wind came along, banging the loose things in the
open cabin right and left. The wind took Frank’s
cap from his head and sent it spinning aft.</p>

<p>“My cap!” cried the youth and started after it.</p>

<p>“Be careful of yourself!” came from the professor,
but the fury of the wind drowned out his
voice completely.</p>

<p>Bound to save his cap Frank followed it to the
rail. As he stooped to pick it up the steamer gave
a sudden roll to the opposite side and he was thrown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
headlong. At the same moment the spray came
flying on board, nearly blinding him.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p046.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">“Stay where you are!”</p>

<p>“He’ll go overboard if he isn’t careful!” ejaculated
Mark, and ran after his chum.</p>

<p>“You be careful yourself,” came from Professor
Strong, as he too rushed to the rescue.</p>

<p>Before either could reach Frank the youth had
turned over and was trying to raise himself to his
feet. But now the steamer rolled once more and
in a flash Frank was thrown almost on top of the
rail. He caught the netting below with one hand
but his legs went over the side.</p>

<p>“Oh!” burst out Mark, and could say no more,
for his heart was in his throat. He thought Frank
would be washed away in a moment more. The
spray still continued to fly all over the deck and at
times his chum could scarcely be seen.</p>

<p>“Stay where you are,” called out Professor
Strong, to Mark. Then he turned and in a moment
more was at the rail and holding both Frank
and himself. Following the advice given, Mark
held fast to a nearby window.</p>

<p>By this time a couple of deck hands were hurrying
to the scene, one with a long line. One end of
the line was fastened to the companionway rail and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
the other run out to where the professor and Frank
remained. The boy was all out of breath and could
do but little toward helping himself. But Professor
Strong’s grip was a good one, and it did not
relax until one of the deck hands helped the lad to
a place along the rope. The deck hand went ahead
and the professor brought up the rear, with Frank
between them. In a moment more they were at the
companionway and Frank fairly tumbled below,
with the others following him.</p>

<p>“Gracious, but that was a close shave!” panted
the boy, when able to speak. “I hadn’t any idea
the steamer would roll so much.”</p>

<p>“After this when it blows heavily you must remain
in the cabin,” said Professor Strong, rather
severely. “And if your cap wants to go overboard—”</p>

<p>“I’ll let it go,” finished Frank. “I won’t do
anything like that again for a train load of caps,
you can depend on that.”</p>

<p>The storm increased, and by nightfall it was raining
heavily. The boys had expected a good deal of
thunder and lightning, but it did not come, and by
sunrise wind and rain were a thing of the past and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
the steamer was pursuing her course as smoothly
as ever.</p>

<p>On board the ship were half a dozen passengers
bound for Curaçao, including Herr Dombrich, the
merchant who occupied a portion of Professor
Strong’s stateroom. One of the number going
ashore at the little island was a man from Baltimore,
a fellow with Dutch blood in his veins, who had
formerly been in the saloon business, and who was
far from trustworthy. His name was Dan Markel,
and, strange as it may seem, he had formed a fairly
close acquaintanceship with Jake Hockley.</p>

<p>“I wish I had the money you have,” said Dan
Markel to Hockley, one afternoon, as the two were
sitting alone near the bow of the steamer. “There
are lots of openings in Curaçao for a fellow with a
little capital. The Dutchmen down there don’t
know how to do business. With five hundred dollars
I could make ten thousand in less than a year.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you got five hundred dollars?” asked
Hockley, with interest.</p>

<p>“Not now. I had a good deal more than that,
but I was burnt out, and there was a flaw in my insurance
papers, so I couldn’t get my money from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
company.” Dan Markel told the falsehood without
a blush.</p>

<p>“But what do you expect to do in Curaçao without
money—strike some sort of job?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a rich friend, who has a plantation in
the interior. I think he will give me a place. But
I’d rather establish myself in the town. He wrote
to me that there was a good opening for a tobacco
shop. If I could get somebody to advance me five
hundred dollars I’d be willing to pay back a thousand
for it at the end of six months.”</p>

<p>Now Hockley was carrying five hundred dollars
with him, which an indulgent father had given to
him for “extras,” as he expressed it, for Professor
Strong was to pay all regular bills. The money
was in gold, for gold is a standard no matter where
you travel. Hockley thought of this gold, and of
how he would like it to be a thousand instead of five
hundred dollars.</p>

<p>“I’ve got five hundred dollars with me,” he said,
in his bragging way. “My father gave it to me
to have a good time on.”</p>

<p>“Then you must be rich,” was the answer from
the man from Baltimore.</p>

<p>“Dad’s a millionaire,” said Hockley, trying to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
put on an air of superiority. “Made every cent
of it himself, too.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ve got to pay your way with the
money.”</p>

<p>“No, old Strong pays the bills.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re in luck. I suppose you don’t want
to put that money out at a hundred per cent. interest,”
went on Dan Market, shrewdly. “It would
be as safe as in a bank, my word on it.”</p>

<p>“I want to use the money, that’s the trouble. I
intend to have a good time in Venezuela.”</p>

<p>“You ought to have it, on that money. I wish
I had your chance. Caracas is a dandy city for
sport, if you know the ropes.”</p>

<p>“Then you have been there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, four years ago,” answered Markel, and
this was another falsehood, for he had never been
near South America in his life. He had spent his
time in drifting from one city in the United States
to another, invariably leaving a trail of debts behind
him.</p>

<p>“And you know the people?”</p>

<p>“Yes, some of the very best of them. And I
can show you the best of the cock fighting and the
bull fighting, too, if you want to see them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“That’s what I want,” answered Hockley, his
eyes brightening. “No old slow poke of a trip for
me. I suppose Professor Strong expects to make
us toe the mark everywhere we go, but I don’t intend
to stand it. I came for a good time, and if I
can’t get it with the rest of the party I’m going to
go it on my own hook.”</p>

<p>“To be sure—that’s just what I’d do.” Dan
Markel slapped Hockley on the back. “Hang me
if you ain’t a young man after my own heart. For
two pins I’d go down to Caracas with you, just to
show you around.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would!” cried Hockley.</p>

<p>“The trouble is while I can spare the time I can’t
spare the money. I’d take you up in a minute if it
wasn’t for that.”</p>

<p>“Never mind the money—I’ll foot the bill,” answered
Hockley, never dreaming of how his offer
would result. “I’d like to have a companion who
had been around and who knew where the real
sport lay. You come with me, and you can return
to Curaçao after our crowd leaves Caracas.”</p>

<p>A talk of half an hour followed. Markel pretended
to be unwilling to accept the generous offer
at first, but at length agreed to go with Hockley and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
remain with him so long as the Strong party stopped
at Caracas. He was to show Hockley all the
“fancy sports” of the town and introduce him to a
number of swells and “high rollers.” On the
strength of the compact he borrowed fifty dollars
on the spot, giving his I. O. U. in exchange, a bit
of paper not worth the ink used in drawing it up.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>A PLAN THAT FAILED</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Hockley</span> has found a new friend,” observed
Mark to Sam that afternoon. “A man a number
of years older than himself, too.”</p>

<p>“So I’ve noticed, Mark. I must say I don’t
quite fancy the appearance of the stranger.”</p>

<p>“Nor I. He looks rakish and dissipated. I
wonder where he is bound?”</p>

<p>“I heard him speaking about getting off at Curaçao.
If that’s the case we won’t have him with us
after to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Do we stop at the island to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll be there before noon, so the professor
says.”</p>

<p>Just then Darry appeared and joined them. He
had been in the cabin, and Hockley had introduced
Dan Markel to him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Markel is a great talker, but I don’t take
stock in much he says,” said Darry. “Hockley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
evidently thinks him just all right. He was going
to stop at Curaçao but has changed his mind and
is going right through to Caracas. He says he
knows Caracas like a book.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he intends to take Hockley around,”
suggested Sam.</p>

<p>“It was my impression we were all to go around
with the professor,” came from Mark.</p>

<p>“That was the plan,” said Darry. “He’d have
a good deal of bother if he allowed everyone to run
off where he pleased. I don’t believe Hockley liked
it much because I didn’t seem to care for his new
friend.”</p>

<p>“Let him think as he pleases—we haven’t got to
put ourselves out for his benefit,” said Mark; and
there the subject was dropped for the time being.</p>

<p>In the meantime Frank had met Hockley and
Dan Markel coming out of the stateroom the latter
occupied. Markel had asked the lank youth to come
below and take a drink with him, and Hockley had
accepted, and a first drink had been followed by two
more, which put Hockley in rather an “elevated”
state of mind, even though he was used to drinking
moderately when at home.</p>

<p>“My very best friend, Frank,” he called out.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
“Mr. Dan Markel. Mr. Markel, this is one of our
party, Frank Newton, of New York city.”</p>

<p>“Happy to know you,” responded Market, giving
Frank’s hand a warm shake. “It’s a real pleasure
to make friends on such a lonely trip as this.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t found it particularly lonely,” said
Frank, stiffly. He was not favorably impressed by
the appearance of the man from Baltimore.</p>

<p>“That’s because you have so many friends with
you, my boy. With me it was different. I didn’t
know a soul until Mr. Hockley and myself struck
up an acquaintanceship.”</p>

<p>“But now it’s all right, eh?” put in Hockley,
gripping Markel’s shoulder in a brotherly way.</p>

<p>“To be sure it’s all right,” was the quick answer.
“We’ll stick together and have a good time. Perhaps
young Newton will join us?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, but I shall stick to my chums,” answered
Frank, coolly, and walked off, leaving Markel
staring after him.</p>

<p>“The little beggar!” muttered Hockley, when
Frank was out of hearing. “I’d like to wring his
neck for him.”</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the trouble?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing in particular, but somehow he and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
the rest of the crowd seem to be down on me, and
they are making it as unpleasant as they can at every
opportunity.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say! It’s a wonder Professor Strong
permits it.”</p>

<p>“They take good care to be decent when he’s
around, and of course I’m no tale bearer, to go to
him. But I would like to fix young Newton.”</p>

<p>“Is he worse than the others?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes I think he is. Anyway, if I got
square on him it might teach the others a lesson.”</p>

<p>Frank joined his chums and told what had taken
place. At the next meal Markel was introduced to
the others, but all ignored him, and even Professor
Strong showed that he did not like the idea of
Hockley picking up such an acquaintance.</p>

<p>The fact that he had been snubbed made Dan
Markel angry, and feeling that Hockley was now
his friend and would back him up, he let out a stream
of abuse, in the privacy of his stateroom, with the
lank youth taking it in and nodding vigorously.</p>

<p>“You are right, that little cub is the worst,” said
Markel, referring to Frank. “He needs taming
down. I wish I had him under my care for a week
or two, I’d show him how to behave.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>“I’ve been thinking of an idea,” retorted Hockley,
slowly. “It would be a grand scheme if we
could put it through.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“We are going to land at Curaçao to-morrow.
I wish I could arrange it so one of the other fellows
would be left behind to paddle his own canoe. It
would take some of the importance out of him.”</p>

<p>“Well, that might be arranged,” returned Markel,
rubbing his chin reflectively. “Perhaps we
might fix it so that all of them were left there
stranded.”</p>

<p>“How long will the steamer stay there?”</p>

<p>“Six hours, so I heard the captain tell one of the
other passengers.”</p>

<p>“The trouble is we’ll all have to go ashore with
the professor, if they let us go ashore at all.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll try to think up some scheme,” said
the man from Baltimore; and then the subject was
changed.</p>

<p>Curaçao is the largest and most important of the
Dutch West Indian Islands, with a population of
about 25,000 souls. The island is largely of a phosphate
nature, and the government derives a handsome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
income from the sale of this product. To the
east of Curaçao is Bonaire, another Dutch possession,
and to the west Aruba, all of which are likely
to become a part of United States territory in the
near future. The islands are of considerable importance,
and trade not alone in phosphate of lime
but also in salt, beans, dyewoods and fruits.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the dim outlines of Curaçao
could be seen and about ten o’clock the steamer
glided into the bay of St. Anna, upon which Willemstad,
the capital city is located. The harbor is
a commodious one, and ships displaying the flags
of many nations were on every hand.</p>

<p>“What a pretty town!” exclaimed Mark, as he
surveyed the distant shore with a glass. “I declare
it looks like some of these old Dutch paintings.”</p>

<p>“This island is famous in history,” said Professor
Strong, who stood by. “It was discovered
by the Spaniards in 1527. About a hundred years
after that the Dutch took it and held it for nearly
two hundred years. Then the English came over
and wrested it from the Dutch, but had to give it
back eight years later, in 1815. The pirates and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
buccaneers used to find these islands excellent stopping
places, and many a political refugee has ended
his days on them.”</p>

<p>“Is the capital very large?”</p>

<p>“About fifteen thousand inhabitants.”</p>

<p>“How about going ashore and taking a look
around?” questioned Darry. “I’d like first rate to
stretch my legs on land once more.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, do let us go ashore?” pleaded Frank.
“The steamer is going to stay five or six hours, and
that will give us loads of time for looking around.”</p>

<p>“I will see what can be done when we anchor,”
said the professor. “They may be very strict here—I
do not know.”</p>

<p>Soon the big steamer was close up to the wharf
where she was to discharge part of her cargo and
passengers. One of the first parties to leave was
Herr Dombrich, who shook hands cordially with the
professor.</p>

<p>“It has been von great bleasure to sail mit you,”
said the Dutch merchant. “I vos hobe ve meet
again, not so?”</p>

<p>“I’m thinking of taking the boys ashore,” said
the professor. “They would like to see the city.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“Yes, yes, surely you must do dot,” was the reply.
“I vould go mit you, but I must on pisiness go to de
udder side of de island. Goot py!” and in a moment
Herr Dombrich was ashore and lost in a
crowd. Then Mark caught a glimpse of him as he
was driven away in an old-fashioned Dutch carriage
which had been waiting for him.</p>

<p>An interview was had with some custom house
and other officials, and the party obtained permission
to go ashore and roam around the place until
the steamer should set sail for La Guayra. In the
meantime Dan Markel had already disappeared up
one of the long docks.</p>

<p>The man from Baltimore was in a quandary. He
had borrowed fifty dollars from Hockley, and he
was strongly inclined to hide until the steamer
should sail and then use the money to suit himself.
But he realized that his capital, which now represented
a total of eighty dollars, would not last forever,
and a brief look around Willemstad convinced
him that it was not at all the city he had anticipated.</p>

<p>“I’d starve to death here, after the money was
gone,” he reasoned. “I’ll wager these Dutchmen
are regular misers. The best thing I can do is to go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
to Caracas with that crowd and then squeeze that
young fool out of another fifty, or maybe a couple
of hundred.”</p>

<p>He had come ashore after another talk with
Hockley, in which he had promised to lay some
plan whereby one or another of the boys might be
left behind. He had been told by the captain of the
steamer that the vessel would sail at five o’clock
sharp. If he could only manage to keep somebody
ashore until ten or fifteen minutes after that hour
the deed would be done.</p>

<p>The day was hot and, as was usual with him,
Markel was dry, and he entered the first wine shop
he discovered. Here he imbibed freely, with the
consequence that when he arose to go his mind was
far from being as free as it had been.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll go and see a little more of the town
on my own hook before I try to make any arrangements,”
he muttered to himself, and strolled on until
another drinking place presented itself. Here he
met another American, and the pair threw dice for
drinks for over an hour. Then the man from Baltimore
dozed off in a chair, and did not awaken
until a number of hours later.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>FROM CURAÇAO TO LA GUAYRA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Leaving</span> the steamer, our friends proceeded to
the main thoroughfare of Willemstad, a quaint old
street, scrupulously clean—a characteristic of every
Dutch town—and with buildings that looked as if
they had been moved over from Amsterdam. Not
far off was the home of the governor of the island,
a mansion with walls of immense thickness. The
place fronted the bay and near by was something of
a fortress with a few ancient cannon. Here a number
of Dutch soldiers were on duty.</p>

<p>“I will see if I cannot get carriages, and then we
can drive around,” said Professor Strong, and this
was done, and soon they were moving along slowly,
for no Dutch hackman ever thinks of driving fast.
Besides it was now the noon hour, and the hackmen
would rather have taken their midday nap than earn
a couple of dollars. The boys soon discovered that
in the tropics to do anything, or to have anything
done for you, between the hours of eleven to three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
is extremely difficult. Merchants close their places
of business and everybody smokes and dreams or
goes to sleep.</p>

<p>“I see a lot of negroes,” observed Mark, as they
moved along.</p>

<p>“The population is mostly of colored blood,” answered
the professor. “The colored people are all
free, yet the few Dutchmen that are here are virtually
their masters. The negroes work in the phosphate
mines, and their task is harder than that of a
Pennsylvania coal miner ten times over. If we had
time we might visit one of the phosphate works, but
I hate to risk it.”</p>

<p>“For such a small place there are lots of ships
here,” put in Sam.</p>

<p>“That is true and I think the reason is because
this is a free port of entry. The ships bring in all
sorts of things, and some say a good deal of the
stuff is afterwards smuggled into Venezuela and
Colombia.”</p>

<p>They drove on, past the quaint shops and other
buildings, but in an opposite direction to that taken
by Dan Markel. During the drive Hockley had
little or nothing to say. He was worried over the
non-appearance of the man from Baltimore, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
looked for him eagerly at every corner and cross
road.</p>

<p>“He’s made a mess of it,” he thought. “We’ll
be driving back soon and that will be the end of it.”
And then he thought of the fifty dollars and began
to suspect Markel, and something like a chill passed
over him.</p>

<p>“If he cheated me I’ll fix him, see if I don’t!” he
told himself. Yet he felt that he was helpless and
could do nothing, for the loan had been a fair one.</p>

<p>“There is a curious story connected with the
Island of Curaçao,” said the professor, as they
passed along through the suburbs of the capital.
“It is said that in years gone by some of the old
Spanish pirates filled a cave in the interior with gold
and then sprinkled a trail of salt from the cave to
the sea. Some time after that the pirates were captured
and all made to walk the plank. One of them,
in an endeavor to save his life, told of the treasure
and of the trail that had been left. Those who had
captured the pirates immediately sailed for the
island, but before they could reach here a fearful
hurricane came up, washing the land from end to
end and entirely destroying the trail of salt, so that
the treasure has not been unearthed to this day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>For the greater part the road was hard, dusty and
unshaded. But in spots were beautiful groves of
plantains and oranges, while cocoanut palms were
by no means lacking. The houses everywhere were
low, broad, and with walls of great thickness, and in
between them were scattered the huts of the poorer
class, built of palm thatch and often covered with
vines.</p>

<p>On the return they passed an old Dutch saw-mill,
where a stout Dutchman was directing the labors of
a dozen coal-black natives. The natives droned a
tune as they moved the heavy logs into the mill.
They appeared to be only half awake, and the master
threatened them continually in an endeavor to
make them move faster.</p>

<p>“They are not killing themselves with work,”
observed Sam.</p>

<p>“They never work as fast in the tropics as they
do in the temperate zone of our own country,” answered
Professor Strong. “The heat is against it.
Even the most active of men are apt to become easy-going
after they have been here a number of years.”</p>

<p>The drive took longer than anticipated and when
they again reached the docks the steamer was ready
to sail. They were soon on board, and a little later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
St. Anna harbor was left behind and the journey
to Venezuela was resumed.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” asked Mark, of Hockley, when he
saw the lank youth walking through the cabins looking
in one direction and another. “Lost anything?”</p>

<p>“No,” was the curt answer, and then with a
peculiar look in his eyes, Hockley continued:
“Have you seen anything of Mr. Markel since we
came on board?”</p>

<p>“I have not. He got off at Willemstad.”</p>

<p>“I know it. But he was going through to La
Guayra and Caracas.”</p>

<p>“Well, I haven’t seen him,” answered Mark,
and moved on.</p>

<p>Hockley continued his search for over an hour
and then went to the purser, and from that individual
learned that Markel had taken no stateroom
for the coming night nor had he paid passage
money to be carried to La Guayra.</p>

<p>“That settles it,” muttered Hockley to himself,
as he walked off. “He has given me the slip and I
am out my fifty dollars. What a fool I was to
trust him! And I thought he was such a fine fellow!”
And he gripped his fists in useless rage.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
He fancied that he had seen the last of the man from
Baltimore, but he was mistaken.</p>

<p>That night the boys went to bed full of expectations
for the morrow, for the run from Curaçao to
La Guayra, the nearest seaport to Caracas, is but a
short one.</p>

<p>“My, but it’s getting hot!” observed Frank,
while undressing. “It’s more than I bargained
for.”</p>

<p>“You must remember we are only twelve degrees
north of the equator,” answered Mark. “Wait
till we strike the Orinoco, then I guess you’ll do
some sweating. That stream is only about seven
or eight degrees above the line.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless the boys passed a fairly comfortable
night and did not arise until it was time for breakfast.
Then they went on deck to watch for the
first sight of land.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! There’s land!” was Darry’s cry, some
hours later. He held a glass in his hand. “My,
what a mountain!”</p>

<p>One after another looked through the glass, and
at a great distance made out a gigantic cliff overhanging
the sea. As the steamer came closer they
made out the wall more plainly, and saw the lazy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
clouds drifting by its top and between its clefts.
At the foot of the gigantic cliff was a narrow patch
of sand with here and there a few tropical trees and
bushes. Upon the sand the breakers rushed with a
low, booming sound, and in spots they covered the
rocks with a milklike foam.</p>

<p>“I don’t see anything of a town,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“We have got to round yonder point before you
can see it,” answered an under-officer standing near.
“It’s not much of a place, and it’s tucked away
right under the mountain.”</p>

<p>An hour later they rounded the point that had
been mentioned and at a distance made out La
Guayra, which is located on a narrow strip of land
between the great cliff and the sea. They could
see but little outside of several long and narrow
streets running parallel with the mountain. At one
end of the town was a small hill, with several
long, low government buildings and a church or
two.</p>

<p>“When I was here before, one had to be taken
ashore in a small boat,” said Professor Strong.
“The ocean ran with great swiftness along the
beach. But now they have a breakwater and some
first-class docks and there is little trouble.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“The town seems to be hemmed in,” said Sam.
“How do they get anywhere excepting by boat?”</p>

<p>“There is a road over the mountain and a railroad
track, too. But it’s up-hill climbing from beginning
to end.”</p>

<p>“What’s that thing on yonder hillside?” asked
Mark, pointing to a somewhat dilapidated building,
one side of which was set up on long sticks.</p>

<p>“That is the old bull fighting ring. In days gone
by they used to have very fierce fights there and
much money used to be wagered on the contests.
But the folks are beginning to become civilized now
and the bull fighting doesn’t amount to much.”</p>

<p>As soon as the passengers had landed from the
steamer they found themselves in the hands of the
custom-house officials, who proceeded to collect all
they thought was due. In the meantime, while the
professor was busy paying the duties, Mark and
the others strolled through the little park fronting
the pier.</p>

<p>“This isn’t so bad,” said Frank, as he gazed at
the fountain and the heroic statue of General
Guzman Blanco. “Wonder what that big building
behind us is.”</p>

<p>It proved to be the custom house, an ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
building looking for all the world like a fort. There
was a heavy wall, with an arched gateway and a
great staircase leading to the rooms in the upper
part of the building. The walls were of huge stones
and were five to six feet in thickness.</p>

<p>“Whoever built this, built it to last,” said Sam.
“I don’t think anything less than an earthquake
could bring it down.”</p>

<p>“I suppose they have used it for a fort for years,”
said Darry, and he hit the truth exactly. “When
there is a rebellion in a country the custom house is
always more or less of a point of interest.”</p>

<p>They were soon joined by Professor Strong, who
conducted them to a modest looking hotel not many
squares away.</p>

<p>“We will remain here over night and take the
train for Caracas in the morning,” said the professor.
“I want you to see what a triumph of engineering
skill this road is, and you can’t see that
in the darkness.”</p>

<p>“Phew! what a smell!” came from Hockley, as
he turned up his nose. “La Guayra isn’t very
clean.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Hockley, although the town is
much better than it used to be. When I was here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
years ago the streets were literally covered with
filth and there was a good deal of sickness. You
see, it is really nothing but a seaport. Only those
who have to work here will stay.”</p>

<p>Their rooms were not of the best, and during the
night Frank got up several times, declaring that
his bed was inhabited. All were outside by dawn
and saw the sun rise over the rolling sea. Then a
breakfast of rolls, coffee and fish was had and they
proceeded to the railroad station—to take the most
exciting railroad ride that they had ever experienced.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>ON A CLIFF AND UNDER</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Hurrah</span> for a railroad ride over the mountains!”
cried Darry, as they proceeded to the station.
“Wonder how long it will be?”</p>

<p>“Twenty-four miles, so the professor said,” responded
Sam. “He said Caracas is only six miles
away and the mule path isn’t over nine miles long.
But the lowest part of the mountain is nearly a mile
high and the train has to do a lot of twisted traveling
to get over it.”</p>

<p>“Wonder they wouldn’t tunnel the mountain,”
suggested Frank.</p>

<p>“That’s what they are talking of doing,” put in
Hockley, who felt just then like being sociable.
“Somebody has got a franchise, but it’s going to
take millions of dollars.”</p>

<p>The professor had been looking after tickets. He
soon returned and when the train came along they
all got in the first-class compartment, which was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
much better than a very ordinary car at home. The
car sat so close to the rails that the tops of the
wheels had to be bridged over, interfering somewhat
with the seating capacity.</p>

<p>Soon came a long whistle, the conductor waved
his hand and the train moved away, through the
town and in full view of the ocean. The speed
was fair, but nothing to what the boys were used to
at home, yet this was not to be wondered at, for
they were climbing steadily along the face of the
mountain. Up and up they went until Frank, who
sat at a window overlooking the water hundreds
of feet below, could not help but shudder.</p>

<p>“If we should drop off here, there wouldn’t be
anything left of us,” he said to Sam.</p>

<p>“I guess we won’t drop off,” was the reply.
“But say, it does make a fellow dizzy to look down,
doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>The professor sat with them and pointed out several
places of interest as they sped onward. “You
see the tracks follow the mule road in many places.
The path is about nine miles long and in former
days it was the only means of communication between
Caracas and the sea, outside of an old Indian
trail further to our right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>They soon dashed into a tunnel and out again,
and then began another climb along the mountain
side. As they reached a higher elevation they noticed
that the air was cooler.</p>

<p>“We are coming to another tunnel,” said Mark,
as they swung around a sharp curve.</p>

<p>“Yes, and we’re running swifter than before,”
put in Sam.</p>

<p>The next instant found them in the tunnel, rushing
past great masses of black rocks. Nothing but
smoky lamps lit up the car and Mark was gazing
at one of these, when of a sudden the train came to
such a short stop that everybody was pitched forward.</p>

<p>“We’ve struck something,” cried Darry, as he
scrambled up from the floor, to which he had been
hurled.</p>

<p>“Is anybody hurt?” came anxiously from Professor
Strong, as soon as the shock was over and
the car came to a standstill.</p>

<p>“I pinched my hand on the seat,” answered
Mark. “But it doesn’t amount to anything.”</p>

<p>The passengers were climbing out of the train,
to learn the cause of the sudden stoppage. They
found the train hands gathering about the engine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
and with them was a track-walker who had given
them the signal to stop.</p>

<p>“There has been a cave-in ahead, he says,” said
Professor Strong, after listening to the track-walker.
“If the train hadn’t stopped we might all
have been killed.”</p>

<p>The track-walker talked excitedly, in Spanish and
in broken English, and some of the party went
ahead to inspect the cave-in. A large mass of rocks
had fallen and it was easy to see that the track
would not be cleared for several hours.</p>

<p>“Now what’s to do?” grumbled Hockley. “I’m
sure I don’t want to stay boxed up in this tunnel till
they clear that stuff away.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what else we can do,” answered Sam,
“unless we walk all the way back to La Guayra.”</p>

<p>“How far are we from Caracas?” asked Mark,
of one of the passengers.</p>

<p>“About three miles,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Can’t we walk to that place?” asked Mark, of
Professor Strong. “We have nothing but our little
shoulder valises to carry.”</p>

<p>“I think we can walk it,” said the professor. “I
will ask how the track ahead is.”</p>

<p>He did so and was informed that, so far as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
track-walker knew, it was all clear. Accordingly
they started out, the professor and Mark leading
the way and the others following close behind.</p>

<p>They were in the shadow of the mountain so that
the fierce rays of the sun did not reach them. They
had left the tallest portion of the mountain behind,
so the way was now all more or less down grade.</p>

<p>“I move we get off the railroad track and rest,”
said Hockley, after half a mile had been covered.
“We’re in no especial hurry to get to Caracas.”</p>

<p>The professor and the others were willing, and
leaving the track they found shelter along a hillside
covered with tropical trees and bushes. As they
stepped away from the railroad they heard a humming
sound and saw a handcar approaching, filled
with men and tools, bound for the scene of the
cave-in.</p>

<p>“They must have telegraphed for those fellows,”
said Darry. “They will get the road into shape
again in short order.”</p>

<p>It was very pleasant to lie under the trees in the
shade, and Frank was so sleepy that he soon dropped
into a doze. Mark walked around inspecting the
surroundings, and to get a better outlook climbed a
small cliff which arose not far away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>From the elevation of the cliff Mark could get a
good view of the valley stretching out in the direction
of Caracas and could even see some of the white
buildings in the distance. Then the youth walked
along the cliff to where there was a turn, around a
series of rough rocks.</p>

<p>There had been a heavy dew on the mountain the
night before and in the shady spots this had not yet
dried off. As he made the turn his foot trod in
some moisture and slipped, and down he went on
his knee. He tried to save himself by clutching at
some vines but these gave way and over the cliff
he plunged on to some loose rocks below.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Mark, the fall was not a deep
one or some bones might have been broken. The
loose stones and earth gave way beneath his weight
and allowed him to slide swiftly under the cliff into
a long and narrow hollow. Here he went with a
splash into some water up to his knees and some of
the dirt and stones came after him, sending the
moisture all over him.</p>

<p>Mark was so surprised at the turn of affairs that
for the moment he stood perfectly still, panting for
breath. It was dark around him, the only light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
coming from the opening above, which was fully
a dozen feet over his head. In front of him was the
rocky cliff raising itself in a curve over his head.
Behind him was the wall of dirt. The split, if such
it may be called, extended a dozen feet in one direction
and out of sight in the other.</p>

<p>“Now I’m in a pickle and no mistake,” he muttered,
dismally. “How in the world am I going to
get out of this hole?”</p>

<p>The question could not be answered at once and
Mark waited until he had got back some of his
breath. Then he started to move off in the direction
in which the split led.</p>

<p>He soon found that he was on an uncertain footing,
for he had progressed less than a dozen feet
when he began to sink into the pasty ooze of which
the bottom of the opening was composed. The
water was above his knees here and growing deeper.</p>

<p>“No use trying in that direction,” he told himself.
“If there was an opening the water wouldn’t
stand there like that. It’s a regular pocket and if
I’m not careful I’ll plaster myself so fast that I’ll
never get out.”</p>

<p>He thought to cry for help but then realized that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
his friends were a good distance off and that even
if they heard him they would not know exactly how
to reach the opening.</p>

<p>“I must help myself,” he murmured. “Surely I
ought to be able to climb that wall of dirt somehow.
Wonder if my pocketknife won’t help me?”</p>

<p>He brought forth the knife and dug the blade into
the soil among the stones. But it would not hold
and merely brought down more of the wall at his
feet. Then, without warning a big mass of dirt
came down, hurling him to the bottom of the pocket
and covering him completely.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>HOCKLEY SHOWS HIS TRUE COLORS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor Strong</span> had been studying a guide
book which he carried. Presently he closed the
volume, put it into his pocket, and leaped to his feet.</p>

<p>“Come, boys, I think we had better be on our
way.”</p>

<p>“I’m ready,” answered Darry, and aroused
Frank.</p>

<p>Hockley was close at hand, throwing stones at
some birds in a neighboring tree. Now he stopped
and walked over to the railroad track.</p>

<p>“Where is Mark?”</p>

<p>Several asked the question at the same time, and
all looked around for their companion.</p>

<p>“I saw him walking towards yonder cliff last,”
said Sam. “But that was some time ago.”</p>

<p>“Hullo, Mark!” cried Frank. “Where are
you?”</p>

<p>No answer came back, and the cry was repeated
by Darry and Sam. Then the professor shouted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
with all the strength of his lungs. Still there was
no reply.</p>

<p>“This is very strange,” observed the professor,
with a serious look on his face. “I trust he hasn’t
gotten into any trouble. You are sure you saw
him going toward the cliff, Winthrop?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, directly after Frank went to sleep.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go over and take a look around.”</p>

<p>“Let me go with you, please,” said Frank, and
he followed and so did Sam and Darry. Hockley
sat down on the railroad embankment to await their
return.</p>

<p>Sam pointed out the spot where he had last seen
Mark and it did not take the crowd long to reach
that vicinity. All looked around anxiously.</p>

<p>“He isn’t here, that’s sure,” said Professor
Strong. “It’s a mystery what became of him.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he fell over into the bushes below,”
suggested Darry.</p>

<p>At this Frank, who loved Mark as a brother,
gave a shiver and crawled to the edge. But there
was nothing below but dirt and tropical vines, the
latter overrun with big spiders.</p>

<p>“Mark! Mark!” he shouted, and again the
others joined in the cry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>“Hark! I heard something!” exclaimed Sam,
who had walked nearest to the rough rocks where
Mark had first slipped. “Listen.”</p>

<p>All did so, with bated breath. A low groan
reached their ears, sounding as if it had come from
the bowels of the earth.</p>

<p>“It’s Mark! He’s surely had a fall!” gasped
Frank. He raised his voice: “Mark! Mark!
Where are you?”</p>

<p>“Here, under the cliff,” was the faint answer,
and another groan followed.</p>

<p>“Under the cliff?” repeated Professor Strong.
He crawled to the edge and looked around as Frank
had done. “I see no opening, do you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“The cries come from further up the cliff, in that
direction,” said Sam, whose ears seemed to be more
acute than the rest. “Listen! I think he must be
in some hole over yonder.”</p>

<p>The professor hurried toward the rough rocks
and was soon climbing around them. But he was
more careful than Mark had been and made the turn
in safety. He now found himself on another portion
of the cliff and Mark’s groans came from directly
beneath him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“Mark!” he called out. “Are you below
there?”</p>

<p>“I am,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Are you much hurt?”</p>

<p>“My ankle got a bad twist and I was almost
smothered by some dirt covering me.”</p>

<p>The professor said no more just then but tried
to look over the edge of the cliff into the hollow.
In this, however, he was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>But Professor Strong was not a man to be
daunted easily. When out on hunting expeditions
he had at various times, gotten into positions of
extreme peril, and he was used to taking risks.
Measuring the distance to the dirt hill in front of the
cliff, he took a leap and landed in safety. He was
careful not to go too close to the hole so there was
no caving-in as there had been when Mark descended.</p>

<p>“Now, then, I’ll see if I can help you out,” said
the professor, when he caught sight of the youth
resting on top of the dirt that had last fallen.</p>

<p>“Be careful, or you’ll slide down, too,” answered
Mark. “That bank is awfully treacherous.”</p>

<p>Leaving the vicinity of the opening Professor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
Strong began to hunt for something by which Mark
might be hauled up. But nothing was at hand.</p>

<p>“Have you found him?” came from Frank.</p>

<p>“Yes. He is at the bottom of a deep opening.
I will have to haul him out if I can find anything
to do it with.”</p>

<p>“If only we had a rope,” came from Darry.</p>

<p>Each looked around in perplexity.</p>

<p>“Might try some of the vines by twisting them
together,” suggested Frank.</p>

<p>“The vines growing around here are not strong
enough,” called back the professor.</p>

<p>At that moment came a slight rumble from the
railroad and at a distance another handcar hove
into sight, containing several laborers with their
tools.</p>

<p>“Hi! stop that handcar!” called out Frank to
Hockley, who had arisen to watch the car pass.</p>

<p>“What for?” demanded the lank youth.</p>

<p>“The professor wants a rope.”</p>

<p>“Stop the car yourself,” muttered Hockley.
Nevertheless, when the car came near, he waved his
hand for the men to stop working the handles which
kept it in motion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>“What do you want?” asked one of the men,
in a Spanish patois, after the handcar had been
brought to a standstill.</p>

<p>“We want a rope,” said Hockley, without understanding
the man.</p>

<p>The man shrugged his shoulders and so did his
companions. Then Hockley pointed to a rope which
laid coiled up on the car. At this the native smiled,
then looked perplexed.</p>

<p>By this time Professor Strong was hurrying in
the direction. He could speak the language fairly
well and soon made them understand that somebody
was in a hole and had to be hauled out. Then he
held a silver piece out and the native, who was a
sort of foreman, took it instantly. The handcar was
taken from the tracks and all the workmen followed
the professor to the hill in front of the cliff.</p>

<p>When Mark was brought up and placed on the
grass, it was found that his ankle was so swollen
that walking was out of the question. He was wet
and dirty from head to foot and the others did what
they could toward cleaning him off. The handcar
men could not remain and hurried away as soon as
they could get back their rope.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you’re going to do with me,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
said Mark, ruefully. “I’d walk if I could but I
can’t and that’s all there is to it.”</p>

<p>“Does the ankle still hurt when you are resting?”
asked the professor kindly.</p>

<p>“No, only when I try to stand on it.”</p>

<p>“Then rest where you are and I will see what
can be done toward getting a horse or some other
animal to carry you.”</p>

<p>Professor Strong started off toward the mountain
road between La Guayra and Caracas, and the
others gathered about Mark, bathing his ankle with
water from a nearby pool and doing all they could
otherwise to make him comfortable.</p>

<p>“It was a foolish thing to do, attempting to
crawl around that cliff,” observed Hockley, as he
sat by watching proceedings, without offering any
aid. “You’ve got us all into a muss. Goodness
only knows when we’ll get to Caracas now.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t wait for us if you don’t wish to,”
retorted Frank, stung by the lank youth’s harshness.
“You can go ahead—I’m sure we shan’t miss you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you talk to me like that, Frank Newton.
I won’t stand it!” blurted out Hockley, his face reddening.</p>

<p>“I just will talk to you like that, Jake Hockley.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
Mark didn’t get his ankle sprained for fun, and
you know it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let him alone, Frank,” put in Mark. “It
isn’t worth quarreling about.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you fellows will be getting into
trouble right straight along,” continued Hockley,
who seemed to have one of his streaks of ill temper.
“I shan’t put up with it, I’ll tell you that.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get into trouble in another minute, if
you don’t quit,” cried Frank. “The best thing you
can do is to go on to Caracas and leave us alone.”</p>

<p>“That’s all you fellows want—to get clear of
me,” growled the lank youth. “But you can’t do it.
My father’s paying my way, and I’m going to do as
I please, and I’m not going to allow Professor Strong
to consult you and not me in everything either,” he
went on, bitterly.</p>

<p>As he finished speaking he started to move from
one side of the little crowd to the other. He passed
close to Mark and as he did so his foot hit the
swollen ankle and made the youth on the ground
cry out with pain.</p>

<p>“Oh, Hockley, what did you do that for?”</p>

<p>“I—er—I didn’t mean to do it,” answered the
lank youth, surlily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>“You did mean to do it, you mean bully!” ejaculated
Frank, who had seen the movement perfectly.
And in a sudden rage he ran up and shoved Hockley
backward into some brushwood. “If you try it
again, I’ll fight you, small as I am.”</p>

<p>It took the lank youth a few seconds to recover
and then his face was redder than ever. Without a
word he darted for Frank and struck him heavily
in the shoulder. Then he struck out again, but
Frank dodged the blow. A moment more and the
two had clinched and were rolling over and over on
the ground.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />

<small>ON MULE BACK INTO CARACAS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">A fight</span>! A fight!” came from Sam.</p>

<p>“Give it to him, Frank, don’t let him get the best
of you,” put in Darry.</p>

<p>“Stop them,” ordered Mark, trying to rise and
then falling back with a groan of pain. “Stop them,
I say. Glummy is too big for Frank.”</p>

<p>“You let us alone,” growled the bully. “This
is our fight and we’ll settle it between us. He struck
me first.”</p>

<p>While he was talking he was doing his best to
get on top of Frank. But the latter, though small,
proved that he was powerful and Hockley held him
down with difficulty. The lank youth now hit out
again and Frank was struck in the nose and the
blood began to flow from that organ.</p>

<p>“Let me up!” came from the smaller youth. And
then he too struck out, landing on Hockley’s chin.
Then he jerked the lank youth by the arm and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
Hockley rolled over on the grass, and in a moment
Frank was on top.</p>

<p>“Get off!” howled the bully, in a terrible rage
over being thus brought to earth. “Get off, or I’ll
hammer the life out of you!”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to spell able first,” retorted Frank
and struck him in the cheek. “There’s one for
stepping on Mark’s ankle and there’s another to
teach you manners.” He struck out heavily. Then
Hockley pulled him over and they laid side by side
panting and striking and each endeavoring to rise.</p>

<p>Suddenly Frank saw his chance and struck the
bully directly in the mouth. The blow was delivered
with all the force possible and it loosened one of
Hockley’s teeth and made it bleed.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Good for Frank!” cried Sam. “That’s
the sort.”</p>

<p>“Hi! hi! what does this mean, boys?” The call
came from the brushwood close at hand. “Stop
that fighting instantly!”</p>

<p>The voice was that of Professor Strong, and both
Frank and Hockley lost no time in leaping to their
feet. They stepped apart and it must be confessed
that Frank looked at the instructor rather shamefacedly.
Hockley was defiant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>“What have you boys been fighting about?” demanded
Professor Strong, as he came up and gazed
at one and the other sternly.</p>

<p>“Newton started it,” answered Hockley. “He
tackled me without any reason for it.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t true,” cried Frank. “He kicked
Mark’s sore ankle and that made me mad, and I
told him what a brute he was, and shoved him back
out of the way. Then he struck me in the shoulder.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t so, he hit me first,” said Hockley, surlily.</p>

<p>“What Frank says is true,” put in Darry. “He
did kick Mark’s lame ankle, and that was a shame.”</p>

<p>“How about this?” questioned the professor, of
Mark.</p>

<p>“He struck my ankle when he was walking past,
sir. He said it was an accident, but——”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t,” broke in Frank. “I saw him do it
on purpose.”</p>

<p>“Hockley’s been aching for a quarrel ever since
he started,” came from Sam.</p>

<p>“The whole crowd is down on me,” growled the
lank youth. “They want to run things to suit themselves
and leave me out in the cold. My father
pays my way and I don’t see why I should play
second fiddle to anybody.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>“You will not be asked to play second fiddle, as
you term it, Hockley,” said the professor. “But
at the same time I will allow no fighting. We are
here to see the sights, and I expect you all to behave
like young gentlemen. If you did not kick
Mark in the ankle on purpose you should at least
have been more careful of your steps, for a sprained
ankle is nothing to fool with. I see your mouth is
bleeding. You had better bathe it in yonder pool.
And Newton, you go to the next pool and bathe your
nose, and remember, this is the first and last fighting
to be done on this trip.”</p>

<p>Glad to get off thus easily the two boys walked
away as directed and each did what he could to stop
the flow of blood. Sam and Darry wanted to go
after Frank but the professor stopped them.</p>

<p>“I want you two to help me with Mark,” said
Professor Strong. “I have found a native with
several mules. He was carrying cane cuttings to
Caracas, but I have hired him to drop his loads for
the present and carry us instead. If you will join
hands and catch Mark under the knees I will take
him under the arms, and we can carry him to the
road.”</p>

<p>They soon had the crippled youth up and the professor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
pointed out the direction in which the road
over the mountain lay. The path to the point was
thickly overgrown with brush and they had literally
to force their way along. It was rough and more
than once Mark felt like crying out but showed his
grit by shutting his teeth and keeping silent.</p>

<p>Frank soon followed the three and Hockley did
the same. The bully presently ranged up beside
the smaller youth.</p>

<p>“Just you wait, I’ll get square yet,” he said, in a
low tone.</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid of you,” retorted Frank, who
was satisfied that he had fully “kept up his end of
the log,” as the saying is.</p>

<p>“The next time we come to blows I’ll not be so
easy on you,” went on Hockley. He was very angry
to think that the smaller boy had not been afraid of
him.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I won’t be so easy either, Hockley,”
was Frank’s answer, and then he ran on, to aid the
others in getting Mark to the mule path.</p>

<p>Down on the path they found the native, a little,
dried-up old Venezuelan, who had seven mules in
his charge. The patient little beasts were scarcely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
higher than Darry’s shoulder. Four had been unloaded
but the others stood in the road with loads
of sugarcane cuttings so large that only their eyes
and noses could be seen.</p>

<p>“Gracious what loads!” murmured Darry, as he
gazed at the mules.</p>

<p>“These mules will carry about all you can put on
them,” said the professor, with a smile. “I have
seen one mule carrying three men, and trotting along
at that.”</p>

<p>The mules to be used by our friends were soon
ready, and then Mark was placed on the back of the
one the native said was the best. Presently all were
“aboard,” as Darry expressed it, and the native led
the procession in the direction of Caracas.</p>

<p>They could already see the outskirts of the city,
which is located on the southern slope of the La
Silla Mountain. To every side were mountain
peaks, with here and there a small valley with
streams of water of more or less importance. On
the sides of the mule path were plantains and
palms, and further out the sugar and coffee plantations,
with their queer little huts and houses of pink,
blue, and white.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“How large a place is Caracas?” questioned
Sam, as they moved along as rapidly as Mark’s condition
permitted.</p>

<p>“There has been no accurate census taken for
years, but the population is probably 75,000 souls.
You see the laboring classes—called peons here—object
to being enumerated for fear it may mean military
service, and so they hide when the census man
comes around. The whole valley in which the city
lies numbers probably 150,000 souls.”</p>

<p>“The houses look a good deal alike to me,” observed
Sam, as they made their way down one of the
highways leading directly to the Plaza Bolivar, a
park in the center of Caracas. “They all have mud
and plaster walls, red-tiled roofs, windows with bars
over them and no chimneys.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I noticed the absence of chimneys,” put in
Frank, whose nose had now stopped bleeding.
“Wonder what they do when they want fire in a
house?”</p>

<p>“They never want fire,” answered Professor
Strong. “It is too warm for a fire. That is why
they don’t have glass to the windows.”</p>

<p>“But they must cook.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>“They do, but they use charcoal and burn it in a
little contrivance something like a tinsmith’s stove.
You’ll see plenty of them before you leave for
home.”</p>

<p>“They seem to paint their houses all colors,”
muttered Hockley, who now that Frank had spoken
felt he too must say something. “There is a blue
and a white, and there is a red, and here is a brown,
and over yonder an orange.”</p>

<p>“Yes they use any color they please,” answered
the professor. “It is sometimes the only way of
telling one’s house from that of a neighbor. They
may look ugly to you from the outside, but you’ll
find many of them quite handsome and very comfortable
within.”</p>

<p>They had now entered the city proper and the
sights and sounds around them interested the boys
so much that they forgot to talk. Natives were
hurrying by with huge bundles on their heads or
balanced over their shoulders, little children with
hardly any clothes were playing in the roadway,
and the street was almost filled with pedlers and
others on mule back. At one spot they encountered
a native driving several cows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>“He’s delivering his milk,” said the professor.
“He finds out how much a customer wants and
then milks one of his cows to that extent.”</p>

<p>“Then the milk ought to be fresh and rich,” said
Mark, who had found the ride surprisingly comfortable
despite the awkward appearance of his
steed.</p>

<p>“It is fresh enough, but not particularly rich, for
the cows roam where they please and rarely get
enough to eat.”</p>

<p>“I should think a fellow would get all mixed up
in a city where the houses are so much alike,” said
Sam.</p>

<p>“You won’t get mixed after you get the run of
the place, Winthrop. Remember that all the streets
start from the cathedral at the Plaza Bolivar. The
four streets there are called Avenue North, East,
South, and West, and then follow Second Street
North, Second Street East, and so on.”</p>

<p>A few minutes more of riding brought them to
the hotel at which they were to remain during their
stop in Caracas. The professor went inside and announced
their arrival and then the boys and he assisted
Mark to alight. They passed through a large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
iron gateway into a beautiful square filled with
flowers, where a fountain was playing. Then a
servant came to lead them to their rooms, which were
all on the ground floor, and in a few minutes more
they could truly say they were at home in Caracas.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>THE PROFESSOR MEETS AN OLD FRIEND</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">How</span> does the ankle feel?” asked Frank, on the
morning following the arrival at the hotel.</p>

<p>“Somewhat sore, but I can stand on it,” answered
Mark. “I guess it will be all right again in
a day or two;” and it was, although Mark was careful
of the member for some time longer.</p>

<p>Under the guidance of the professor the boys made
several tours of the city. They first visited the Capitol
building, but a short distance from their hotel.
The Capitol is but one story high, but it occupies an
entire square, and is by far the finest building in Venezuela.
In the center is a large court, where a fountain
plays constantly and where grow the most
beautiful of tropical flowers. Here are a number of
rich marble statues.</p>

<p>Opening up from the court are the various official
offices—the Senate and Chamber of Deputies, Interior
and War Departments, Supreme Court, and
others. At one end is a large hall, two hundred feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
long, with inlaid flooring, where public receptions are
held. Here can also be found the portraits of various
notables of Venezuelan history.</p>

<p>“This is Simon Bolivar, the Washington of South
America,” said the professor, as they stopped in front
of a massive portrait at the end of the gallery. “He
was born in this city in 1783, of wealthy parents of
rank, and was sent to Spain to be educated. He became
a lawyer and traveled extensively. While visiting
the United States he became infused with the
spirit of liberty, and returning home joined the
patriots who were trying to throw off the yoke of
Spain. He fought in a number of battles and then
went to England to ask for aid from that country.
But England would grant him nothing, and to escape
the wrath of Spain he had to flee to Curaçao.
But he was not disheartened, and soon after returned
to South America. He began to raise troops of volunteers,
and fought many more battles, in nearly all
of which he was victorious. At last in 1813, he entered
Caracas as a conqueror, was hailed as a liberator,
and made absolute dictator in civil and military
affairs. More battles followed, and Bolivar had to
flee again, this time to Hayti. But he was undaunted,
and coming back whipped the Spaniards once more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
and helped to unite New Granada and Venezuela into
the Republic of Colombia. After that he went to
Peru and aided the Peruvians in establishing their
freedom and a part of the country was named Bolivia
in his honor. He died in 1842.”</p>

<p>“Certainly a great man,” said Darry. “What a
lot of excitement he must have passed through!”</p>

<p>“He certainly did. At first he was but little appreciated,
but as time goes by the people realize what
a truly great man he was.”</p>

<p>“There is a statue of him in Central Park, New
York,” put in Frank. “I have seen it a number of
times, and so has Mark.”</p>

<p>“You will find statues of Bolivar all over South
America and also in Central America and Mexico.
When the folks here realized what he had done for
them, they went wild, and his ashes were brought
here with great pomp and ceremony. He is undoubtedly
the foremost figure in South American
history for three hundred years.”</p>

<p>Professor Strong had received a pass to the Senate
Chamber, and they took a brief look at this somewhat
bare apartment, with its stiff chairs, and its absence
of regular desks.</p>

<p>“Does the President get much?” asked Hockley,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
as they came to a halt out in the court where the
fountain was playing.</p>

<p>“I believe his salary is $12,000 a year. Besides
this he gets his house and servants free, also his livery,
the same as our own President. But you must
remember that the President here is a good deal of a
dictator and can use the money of the government
pretty much as he pleases. Sometimes a president
draws money to suit himself, and then comes a revolution.
This is not alone true of Venezuela, but it is
true of many other South American republics.”</p>

<p>Before leaving the Capitol building they looked in
at the Treasury Department, and Frank asked about
the money of the country.</p>

<p>“I’ve got some of their silver, but I must say I
can’t tell what it is,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well, this is a bolivar,” said the professor, taking
a silver piece somewhat smaller than our quarter
from his pocket. “This bolivar is worth twenty
cents. The next smaller coin is a real, worth ten
cents. Then comes a medio, five cents, a quartillo,
two-and-a-half cents, and a centavo, which explains
itself.”</p>

<p>“But isn’t there anything larger than a bolivar?”
asked Darry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>“Yes, there are two and two-and-a-half bolivars,
and a peso fuerte, which is worth one dollar. After
that come the gold coins, worth four dollars and
twenty dollars. I will show you all of them when
we get back to the hotel.”</p>

<p>Leaving the Capitol, they crossed the square to a
beautiful building of white marble. This is the Central
University, the leading institution of learning
of the Republic.</p>

<p>“This is not a large college as such institutions
are counted in our country,” said the professor.
“There are, I was told, about thirty professors and
the students number about 400. But the course of
study is very thorough, and embraces literature, art,
law, medicine, science, engineering and theology.
Here is also located the National Library of forty-five
thousand volumes, many of which are rare and
valuable. We will walk through, for I am inclined
to think there is a professor here with whom I am
well acquainted.”</p>

<p>They walked through the library building first,
with its long shelves of books and its cabinets of rare
folios, and then into the college proper. Here the
professor hailed a passing student and asked concerning
his friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>“<i>Si, señor</i>, he is here,” said the student, in Spanish.
“He teaches our class in engineering. Would
you like to see him?”</p>

<p>“I would indeed,” answered Professor Strong.
“He and I were college students together.”</p>

<p>“Then follow me to the class room. He is at his
desk. The session has not yet begun.”</p>

<p>Passing through a long and high corridor, they
came to one of the class-rooms and entered. At a
tall desk at one end sat a man of forty-five, working
out a problem on a sheet of paper. He was evidently
a Spaniard but one who had seen a great deal of the
world.</p>

<p>“How are you, Morano,” said the professor, stepping
up and touching him on the arm.</p>

<p>The professor in engineering started up and stared
for a moment. Then his face broke out into a warm
smile, and he caught Professor Strong in both arms
after the fashion of many foreigners.</p>

<p>“Strong, my own very dear friend, Amos
Strong!” he cried, in a rich Spanish accent. “Where
in the world have you come from, and when did you
arrive? It is wonderful! I am so glad! You are
yourself, but you look older. And these boys? Some
of your sons perhaps?” And he took the professor’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
hands and shook them over and over
again.</p>

<p>“I am glad to see you, Morano,” was the professor’s
equally warm reply. “It is fully fifteen
years since we parted, in Paris, after a tour of the
Old World. I tried to see you when I was here before,
but you were down in Peru, helping to build a
railroad bridge.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is so, I remember now. I could not
stand it to teach—it is so hard, so steady, so confining.
Outside it is different. One gets the air, one
can walk about, and one is more happy. Then these
are your sons? What are their names?”</p>

<p>“No, they are not my sons. I am not married.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! A happy bachelor. So am I. Then they
are——?”</p>

<p>“They are my pupils. I have brought them to
South America to show them something of the
country.” The professor brought each one forward
and mentioned his name. “Boys, this is Professor
Enrique Morano, a very dear friend of mine, who
once attended Yale with me, and who afterward
made a tour of Europe with me and several other
students.”</p>

<p>“I am charmed to meet so many from the dear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
United States,” said Professor Morano, as he shook
hands all around. “It is a great country and I am
sorry I could not remain in it longer. But my respected
father—peace to his ashes!—wished me to
return.”</p>

<p>“Then your father is dead?” asked Professor
Strong.</p>

<p>“Yes, he died but four months ago. He took a
trip to Nicaragua, and the journey was too hard for
him. He left me utterly alone. But I should not
bother you with my family afflictions. You are of
course stopping in Caracas.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” and Professor Strong mentioned the hotel.</p>

<p>“You must come to my home—it is just outside of
the city, on the road to Valencia. I am alone there
with the servants and I will be pleased to have company,
and doubly pleased that it is you. You must
make the home your own.”</p>

<p>“We shall be pleased to call,” said Professor
Strong.</p>

<p>“Why cannot you go there this evening, after the
session is over here?” urged Enrique Morano. “We
must talk of old times, must we not? Your pupils
can inspect the coffee plantation which my late
father purchased just before he died. It is now mine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
but I must confess I know not what to do with it. I
am no planter. I am but a civil engineer and—a
hunter, like yourself,” and the Spanish teacher
laughed.</p>

<p>“We will go, and gladly,” answered Amos
Strong. “I wish the boys to examine a coffee plantation
thoroughly.”</p>

<p>“Will you be at the hotel at five o’clock? If so I
will send my carriage for you.”</p>

<p>So it was arranged, and in a moment more they
left the class room, for while the conversation was
going on the place had been filling with pupils, many
of whom stared curiously at the strangers.</p>

<p>“A nice man,” was Darry’s comment when they
were outside. He turned to the professor: “I don’t
wonder you took to him for a college friend.”</p>

<p>“There is no better man than Henry Morano,”
was Amos Strong’s reply. “I liked him from the
first. He is a splendid scholar and an equally good
hunter in the bargain. You can rest assured of a
good time when you are in his company. We are
very fortunate in meeting him.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>MARKEL AGAIN TO THE FRONT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">We</span> will now go over to the City Hall,” said
Professor Strong, when they found themselves in the
Plaza once more. “It is a spot full of interest, especially
for all people of South America, for it was
to them the Cradle of Liberty, the same as our Independence
Hall at Philadelphia.”</p>

<p>The building was but a step away, an ancient
looking affair, with thick adobe walls and small slits
of windows. The rooms are, many of them, small
and uncomfortable, and the decorations tawdry to a
degree.</p>

<p>“Independence was proclaimed here on July 5th,
1811,” said Professor Strong, as they entered a
council chamber located at one corner. “Here the
very best representatives of the country assembled to
throw off the yoke of Spain. Yonder is a faded picture
depicting the event, and the important looking
document on the wall opposite is the declaration itself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
The paper was drawn up by Francisco Miranda,
an able leader, especially civilly, although he was not
so successful in the battle field as Simon Bolivar.
Miranda was a great friend to La Fayette, and when
La Fayette sailed to America Miranda went with
him and served all through the Revolutionary War
under Washington. This planted in his breast the
same seed of liberty that was planted in the breast of
Bolivar.”</p>

<p>“That shows how far-reaching was the influence
of our Revolution,” remarked Sam. “We threw
that tea overboard to some purpose, didn’t we?”</p>

<p>“What is this thing?” asked Hockley, pointing
to a faded banner hanging close at hand.</p>

<p>“That is a relic of Pizarro at the time he went to
conquer Peru. He carried that banner all through
his trail of fire and blood, doing it in the name of
the church, but with a cruelty only equaled by the
worst of savages. This is not the whole of the banner.
It was cut in half and the other portion is in
the National Museum at Bogota.”</p>

<p>An hour was spent at the City Hall viewing other
objects of interest, including the great city marriage
register and the various portraits on the walls. Then
they walked past the Municipal Theater and on to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
new market place, a neat building with cement floor,
where the stalls were divided by lattice-work.</p>

<p>“There is another market place,” said Professor
Strong, “and at present business is divided between
the two. At the other place there are no stalls, but
the traders simply lay their stuff in a heap on the
ground and sit beside it.”</p>

<p>“How nice the vegetables and fruits look!” exclaimed
Frank. “I never saw anything fresher.”</p>

<p>“They have fresh vegetables the year around
here, for they will grow at any time the seed is put
in the ground. They are all picked at night or early
in the morning and brought to the market on mule
or donkey back. You can see for yourself that they
have all the ordinary vegetables with which we are
acquainted. They also have others, like for instance
that yucca, and the arrowroot, bread-fruit, and many
kinds of bananas and delicious pineapples.”</p>

<p>“There is an alligator pear,” said Mark. “I’ve
seen them on some high-toned fruit stands in New
York.”</p>

<p>“The native name is aguacate. Did you notice
the size of the muskmelons? They are just as sweet
as they look, and those big, long whitish peas will
melt like butter in your mouth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>It was now growing hot, and they were glad
enough to leave the market place and go back to the
hotel. As they rambled around they had met many
natives going to or coming from business, some faultlessly
dressed in white duck suits and broad Panama
hats. Many of the hats were exceedingly fine in texture.</p>

<p>“I once owned one that I used at times for six
years,” said the professor, speaking of the hats. “I
could jam it in anywhere and it always came forth
looking as good as ever. But it cost me thirty-five
dollars.”</p>

<p>“Phew! that’s rather steep,” cried Darry. “But
I’ve heard of such big prices before.”</p>

<p>The boys had found the service at the hotel of the
best. The servants were numerous and did everything
with a gravity which at times was to them
almost comical. They were very attentive to all details,
and the guests were not permitted to do a
single thing for themselves.</p>

<p>“My gracious, I think they would eat for me if
I asked them,” said Darry. “Never saw such waiters
in my life. That fellow pushed my chair around for
me, held the glass of water, handed the bill of fare
and didn’t give me a chance to lay it down, and held<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
the butter pat while I buttered my bread. It goes
ahead of anything I ever experienced before.”</p>

<p>“Reckon they’re laying back for tips,” growled
Hockley. “I’ve heard that all these foreign fellows
think they can sponge on the Yankees every time.”</p>

<p>“You won’t have to tip them,” answered Professor
Strong, dryly. “I will attend to that when I
settle our bills.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mind tipping them,” answered the
lank youth, hastily. “I always give the waiters
something at home.”</p>

<p>After lunch the whole party took it easy in the
court by the fountain, where there were numerous
easy chairs and hammocks. Mark and Frank fell
asleep, and soon after Darry and Sam followed.
But Hockley was restless and at last got up to walk
around.</p>

<p>He had just entered the office of the hotel when
the clerk came toward him holding up an envelope.</p>

<p>“A message for Mistair Jacob Hockley,” he said.</p>

<p>“That’s my name,” returned Hockley, and took
the message wondering whom it was from and what
it contained.</p>

<p>It was a cablegram, sent from Curaçao, and was
signed “Daniel Markel.” It read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>“Unexpectedly delayed. Coming to-morrow.
Meet me at Hotel Ziroda.”</p>
</div>

<p>“So he was delayed and is coming to-morrow,”
muttered Hockley, as he gazed at the cablegram.
“Hullo, it’s dated yesterday. In that case he’ll be
at the Hotel Ziroda to-day. I’d like to know what
he has to say for himself.”</p>

<p>Stuffing the message in his pocket he went up to
the clerk and asked that individual where the Hotel
Ziroda was located. Receiving the information he
started to go back to where he had left the professor,
then suddenly changed his mind.</p>

<p>“He may refuse me if I ask him about going,” he
mused. “I’d better go and say nothing.” And off
he started, bent on seeing Dan Markel and learning
what the man from Baltimore had to say for himself.</p>

<p>The Hotel Ziroda was an ancient hostelry, square
in shape, with a small arched doorway leading to the
inevitable court inside. It had seen better days and
was far from prosperous. A greasy landlord sat in
a wicker chair, half asleep, and with a lighted cigar
hanging from his teeth.</p>

<p>“Hullo, are you the proprietor?” asked Hockley,
touching him on the arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>“What do you want?” asked the man, in Spanish,
as he tried to rouse up.</p>

<p>“I say, are you the proprietor?”</p>

<p>“<i>Si, señor.</i>”</p>

<p>“Is there a man here by the name of Markel—Daniel
Markel? He came from Willemstad yesterday?”</p>

<p>“<i>Si, señor.</i> Markel, <i>señor</i>, he ees here. Come, I
show you.”</p>

<p>With a profound sigh the hotel man arose and conducted
Hockley through the dirty court to a room
in one corner of the building. He knocked and a
voice inside called out: “Who’s there?”</p>

<p>“It’s me,” answered Hockley, without regard to
grammar.</p>

<p>“Me, who?”</p>

<p>“Hockley. I just got your cablegram.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Markel leaped from the bed upon which
he had been lying and opened the door. “Glad
to see you. Come in,” and Hockley went in,
and the hotel proprietor left the pair to themselves.</p>

<p>The room was large and scantily furnished, with a
bed, washstand, table and one chair. On the table
stood Markel’s valise, a bottle of liquor and a glass,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
and a box of cigars. The room was half full of
smoke and smelt far from pleasant.</p>

<p>“Never so sorry in all my life,” said the man from
Baltimore, as he drew up the chair for Hockley to sit
down while he sank on the edge of the bed. “I suppose
you thought I had given you the go by.” He
glanced keenly at the lank youth to see the effect of
his words.</p>

<p>“I—I didn’t know what to think,” stammered
Hockley.</p>

<p>“When I found the steamer gone I was fairly
wild, Hockley, indeed I was. I said to myself,
‘He’ll think I’m a thief sure, for I’ve a cool half
hundred of his money.’ I wanted to send you word,
but I was so upset I forgot about the cable until afterwards.
Here, have a drink and I’ll tell you all about
it.”</p>

<p>He handed Hockley the bottle and the glass, and
the youth had not the courage to resist. He took a
small drink of the fiery stuff, which fairly burnt his
throat as he swallowed it.</p>

<p>“Well, how did it happen?” he questioned.</p>

<p>“It was a funny thing. I went ashore to transact
a little business with an old Dutch importer who used
to do business with a firm that can oysters in Baltimore.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
Well, while I was in the place two natives
came in and another native followed. First thing
I knew one of the first natives had picked the other’s
pocket. The man who was robbed accused the third
native of the crime. There was a big row and they
were going to carry off the innocent man to jail when
I stepped up and told the old Dutchman how it was
and what I had seen. A policeman was called, and
as a consequence I had to go to the station house
and remain there all night as a witness to the affair.
I tried my best to get away and to send you word,
but I couldn’t do a thing with those sleepy Dutch
officials. They left me to my misery and there I had
to remain until ten o’clock the next morning. Then
the case came up and what do you think? Nobody
made any charge and everybody was dismissed: Disgusted?
Well, of course I was, but what could I
do?”</p>

<p>“It was enough to make anybody mad,” was
Hockley’s comment.</p>

<p>“I threatened to sue the city for false imprisonment,
but they only laughed at me. So then I hunted
up a vessel bound for La Guayra and finally sent the
cablegram—and here I am. How have you been?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m well enough.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“Seen anything of the city?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the professor has piloted us to one place
and another. But it’s mighty slow looking at old
buildings and documents and pictures, I didn’t
come for that. I came for a good time.”</p>

<p>“Right you are, and a good time you shall have,
so long as we are together. I promised to show you
the ins and outs of Caracas and I’m going to do it,”
concluded Dan Markel as he slapped Hockley on the
back. “We’ll paint the town red, eh?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>A PLANTATION HOME IN VENEZUELA</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Guess</span> I’ve been asleep, and guess the others have
been asleep, too.”</p>

<p>It was Frank who uttered the words as he roused
up and rubbed his eyes. Mark was still sleeping and
Darry and Sam had just stirred like himself. The
professor was dozing with a guide book resting on
his lap. Everything around the hotel was quiet,
only the dripping of the fountain breaking the stillness.</p>

<p>“It’s a sleepy man’s land during midday,” remarked
Darry, as he arose slowly to his feet. “The
air takes all the ambition out of a fellow. I don’t
wonder that no business is transacted excepting during
the early morning and late in the afternoon.”</p>

<p>The boys walked around the hotel and then into
the street beyond. A few natives were moving about,
but that was all. The sun, striking the pavement,
made the place like a furnace, and they were glad to
retreat once more to the shelter of the court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>“Where is Hockley?” asked Professor Strong,
as he, too, roused up.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Darry, and the others
said the same.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he is taking a look around on his own
account,” suggested Mark. “He said something
about wanting to see the lumber yards, so that he
could write to his father and tell him how they handled
lumber down here.”</p>

<p>“They handle it here very much as they do everywhere
else in South America,” answered the professor.
“Some is carried on wagons, but a great deal
is transported on the backs of mules.”</p>

<p>“How can a mule carry a long stick of timber?”
asked Frank. “If he carried it sideways it would
more than block the street.”</p>

<p>“They use two or more mules and it is wonderful
how they balance the loads. Then, too, the natives
carry a great lot of things on their shoulders and
heads.”</p>

<p>“What are the real natives?” asked Darry. “I’ve
seen all sorts of people here—white, black, red, and
mixed.”</p>

<p>“The real natives are the Indians, Crane,” returned
the professor, with a smile. “They lived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
here long before the days of Columbus, just as they
inhabited our own country. Next to the Indians
come the Spaniards who were the first settlers. The
Spaniards introduced the negroes, who came from
Africa and from the West Indies as slaves. The intermixture
of these races have produced the mestizoes,
who are of Spanish and Indian blood, the
mulattoes, of negro and creole blood, and the zambos,
of negro and Indian blood. These people are also
intermixed, so that it is sometimes impossible to tell
what a person is.”</p>

<p>“Like the man in New York who came up to be
naturalized,” said Mark. “His father was an
Englishman and his mother a Frenchwoman. His
grandfather had been born in Germany and his
grandmother in Italy. He had emigrated to Canada
and there married a Canadian Indian woman. Then
he had moved down to New York, and his oldest
daughter had married an Irishman. If they have any
children it will be hard to tell what they will be.”
And there was a general laugh at this sally.</p>

<p>“They’ll be Americans,” said Frank. “Uncle
Sam’s flag is wide and broad enough to cover them
all, if they care to come under the folds of Old
Glory.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>At last came the hour when Enrique Morano’s carriage
could be expected and soon a fine turnout hove
into sight, drawn by a team of white horses.</p>

<p>“That’s as fine a carriage as any in Central Park,”
said Frank.</p>

<p>“It is probably of United States manufacture,”
answered the professor. “We export a great number
of vehicles to South America.”</p>

<p>“Evidently they appreciate good horseflesh,” put
in Mark. “Here come a couple of horsemen now.
The town is beginning to wake up.”</p>

<p>The horsemen dashed by in a spirited manner,
clad in white with broad sashes at their waists, and
wearing sweeping hats which flapped gracefully in
the warm wind. In the rear rode an attendant, carrying
a small hamper filled with refreshments.</p>

<p>As Hockley was not at hand, the professor asked
the driver of the carriage to wait a little, while he
took a look around the square. But the youth was
nowhere to be seen and Professor Strong came back
looking somewhat worried.</p>

<p>“He knew when we were to leave,” he said. “I
can’t understand this.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Hockley takes his time about everything,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
put in Sam. “He said he was down here for pleasure,
and that he was going to suit himself.”</p>

<p>“He has no right to keep the whole party waiting,”
answered the professor briefly. He said no
more, but his eyes showed that his mind was busy.</p>

<p>“Hockley will get a lecture when he shows up,”
whispered Frank to Darry.</p>

<p>“He’ll get only what he deserves, Darry. Isn’t
that so, Beans?”</p>

<p>“To be sure,” came from Sam. “He howled
about us delaying him at the railroad cliff; now
he’s doing the same thing himself.”</p>

<p>Quarter of an hour went by and the boys wondered
if the professor would make them give up the
trip if Hockley did not return. Then came a messenger
with a note for Professor Strong. The note
was from Hockley and ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Professor Strong</span>: Have just met
some old friends of my father, and they wish me to
spend the evening with them as they are bound for
Philadelphia to-morrow. Please excuse me from
going to that plantation with you. Will be at the
hotel when you get back.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>“Hockley has met some friends and wishes to stay
with them a few hours,” said the professor. “We
will go without him.”</p>

<p>“I’m just as well satisfied,” murmured Mark, but
in a low voice, so that Professor Strong did not hear
him.</p>

<p>They were soon seated in the carriage, the negro
driver touched up the pair, and away they rolled,
down the smooth street, around a corner of the
public square and on toward the road leading to
Valencia, which is located on the lake of the same
name, and on the line of a railroad between the two
points.</p>

<p>“When I was here before, the railroad ran no
further than Victory, a two days’ drive in a carriage,”
said the professor, when Caracas was left
behind and they found themselves climbing over the
hills on a road lined with beautiful tropical trees.
“Now one can go straight through to Valencia
and also part of the way around the lake. There
is also a railroad from Valencia to Puerto Cabello,
on the seacoast, west of La Guayra, and a steamer
runs every ten days between the two seaports.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see much but coffee plantations around
here,” observed Mark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>“Coffee and cocoa is the great industry in this
valley, for Caracas affords an easy market for shipments.
Caracas chocolate, made from the cocoa
bean, is known everywhere, and so is Maracaibo
coffee.”</p>

<p>“Hockley was saying that Mocha coffee came
from here,” put in Frank. “But I said it came
from Arabia.”</p>

<p>“So it does come from Arabia. But there is a
kind of coffee grown here which is a good deal like
Mocha in flavor and is often sold as such.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know something about coffee raising,”
put in Darry. “We drink so much of the stuff that
I think we ought to know about it.”</p>

<p>“I will explain when we get to Professor Morano’s
plantation.”</p>

<p>An hour’s drive from Caracas brought them to
the entrance of the plantation and they passed
through a wide gateway along a broad and well kept
path lined with giant palms. Between the palms
were urns of flowers, all blooming in red, yellow and
blue. Trailing vines were also in evidence, and they
covered the stone wall which separated the plantation
from the highway.</p>

<p>The plantation house proved to be an old and substantial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
affair, one story in height, and occupying the
space of a small city block. The outside was decorated
with stucco work painted in pale blue and
yellow. There was the usual archway in front, over
which was erected a lattice-work covered with trailing
plants.</p>

<p>The civil engineer, for such Enrique Morano
really was, was already there to receive them, in
spotless white, even to the tie with a diamond which
he wore.</p>

<p>“Welcome, three times welcome to all of you!”
he cried, gaily, as he ran forward and assisted Professor
Strong to alight. “You have given me a
great pleasure by coming, and while you stay you
must make yourselves perfectly at home.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, we will, Morano,” answered the professor.</p>

<p>They were soon inside the building, which was
built, like so many others, in the form of a hollow
square. The patio was a garden of flowers, with a
single giant palm in the center. There was a broad
veranda running entirely around the house, with two
steps at either side of the passage leading to the outside.
The flooring of the veranda was of two kinds
of wood, laid in fancy designs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>“Come into the parlor,” said Enrique Morano,
and led the way into an apartment facing the highway
beyond. It was a room at least twenty feet
square, with a polished floor partly covered with
rugs. The furniture was of hardwoods, elaborately
carved but without any fixed coverings.</p>

<p>“Not so very different from a summer parlor at
home,” whispered Frank, when they were left alone
for a moment.</p>

<p>“They don’t cover the furniture on account of the
bugs and insects,” said the professor.</p>

<p>Opening up from the parlor was a library and
smoking room. Enrique Morano had furnished this
to suit himself, and it was very much in the style of a
rich college man at Princeton or Yale. There was a
case of books and files of the latest papers and magazines,
and also a case containing cigars, cigarettes,
smoking tobacco and pipes.</p>

<p>“A regular den!” cried Professor Strong, his
face brightening. “And just as you had it in the
olden days.”</p>

<p>“It reminds me of good old times,” answered
Enrique Morano. “Those college days! I shall
never forget them, nor the many friends I made in
the United States.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>He asked them to sit down, while he offered the
professor a cigar. The boys were glad enough to
look over the files of native papers and Spanish
magazines, although they could read but little.
There were <i>El Diario de Caracas</i>, the leading daily
of the capital, <i>El Pregonero</i>, another daily, and a
magazine with some reproductions of pictures from
American and foreign weeklies.</p>

<p>“What funny advertisements,” said Mark, as he
spelt one and another out. “Here is a store that
has for sale American sewing machines of the latest
fashions, and another that sells clothing that will
make a man look like a President.”</p>

<p>While Professor Strong and his old friend were
smoking and conversing the boys were told to roam
through the house at will, and this they did. Next
to the library they found a dining hall, long and
broad, with a table in the center which was so heavy
none of the boys could budge it. Here the tableware
was of solid silver and of the finest cut glass.</p>

<p>Passing from the dining hall, they entered a narrow
corridor, with bed chambers on either side. Here
the windows were covered with bamboo or venetian
blinds. All of the beds stood in the center of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
apartments, never against a wall. There were handsome
dressing cabinets, also of massive wood in
fancy designs. Between the bedrooms was a large
bathroom, where the bath was nothing less than a
small swimming pool, the top being on a level with
the floor.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! a fellow can take a regular swim
here!” cried Frank. “No wonder these folks look
so clean. I’d want to bathe in that all the time.”</p>

<p>Beyond the bedrooms was the kitchen, in which
the most of the food for the table was prepared.
Attached to the kitchen was a small room of rough
stone, in which were located half a dozen tiny charcoal
stoves for cooking.</p>

<p>The servants attached to the place were as interesting
as the house itself. A little negro boy went
around with them. He had learned to say, “Yes,
mistair,” and “No, mistair,” and he repeated these
over and over again, each time bowing profoundly
and rolling his eyes in a truly comical fashion. The
boy’s name was Bulo, and our friends took to him
from the start.</p>

<p>“Pretty big house,” said Mark, as they stopped
near the kitchen, where a dozen girls were at work,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
some preparing dinner and some shining tableware,
all under the directions of a tall Spanish housekeeper.</p>

<p>“Yes, mistair,” said Bulo, and bowed to the
ground.</p>

<p>“How many servants?” questioned Darry.</p>

<p>“No, mistair,” replied the little colored youth,
and bowed again.</p>

<p>“I said, how many servants?” repeated Darry.</p>

<p>“Yes, mistair, no mistair,” returned Bulo, and
bowed half a dozen times, then as the boys laughed
he laughed too, showing two rows of pure white
ivories.</p>

<p>“You’re all right, Bulo,” said Mark, after the
merriment was over. “Here’s a souvenir for you,”
and he handed the colored boy a medio, which, as
mentioned before, is worth five cents.</p>

<p>“Yes, mistair, yes, mistair,” said Bulo, with glistening
eyes. And as he stuffed the coin in his shirt,
he bowed half a dozen times again, and then, considering
himself dismissed ran off, singing at the
top of his voice.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>A LOSS OF HONOR AND MONEY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> will now go back to Dan Markel and Hockley,
and see how the lank youth fared at the hands of the
man from Baltimore.</p>

<p>The proposition of Markel to “paint the town
red,” appealed to Hockley, but he looked glum when
he heard the words.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’d like to go with you,” he said. “But I
can’t.”</p>

<p>“Can’t? And why not, my dear boy?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to stay around with the professor and
the rest. We’re to visit a coffee plantation this
afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s dead slow.”</p>

<p>“I know it is, and I don’t want to go, but I don’t
see how I’m to get out of it.”</p>

<p>Dan Markel lit a fresh cigar and handed the box
to his visitor. “We must think of some scheme,”
he said, slowly. “Ah, I have it. Write a note saying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
that you have met some old friends and won’t
be back.”</p>

<p>“But he’ll want to know about the friends to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Will he? Then state they are about to sail—anything
to smooth it over. He can’t expect you to
tie fast to his coat-tails all the time, you know.
You’re too big for that.”</p>

<p>“To be sure I’m too big,” blustered Hockley,
lighting one of the cigars and making an attempt to
enjoy it. “Let me have some paper and I’ll send
the note.”</p>

<p>Paper was produced and also a pencil, and soon
the note was finished and given to one of the boys
outside to deliver. Of course the message was a
complete falsehood, yet it did not appear to trouble
Hockley’s conscience.</p>

<p>“Now what shall we do first?” asked the youth,
after Markel had taken another drink from the
bottle.</p>

<p>“When are the others going to start for that
plantation?”</p>

<p>“They are starting about now,” answered Hockley,
after consulting his watch.</p>

<p>“What time have you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“Half-past five.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t you slow?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. This watch is a first-class timepiece,
and it ought to be, for it cost my dad a hundred
and twenty-five dollars.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” Dan Markel’s eyes glistened.
“Mine is a poor thing alongside of that. It only
cost twenty-five dollars.” He arose and stretched
himself. “Let us go and have something to eat
first, and then I’ll show you some sights worth
seeing.”</p>

<p>They entered the dining room, and Markel ordered
an elaborate repast with wine. It was a long
time before it was served and then it was not nearly
as good as what Hockley had had at the other hotel.</p>

<p>“Guess they’ve been changing cooks here,” observed
Markel, when he saw that the youth did not
relish the food. “Had splendid feed when I was
here before. The very freshest of everything. I’ll
have to find another place by to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Come over to where we are,” suggested Hockley.</p>

<p>“Thanks, perhaps I will.”</p>

<p>It was dark by the time the repast was finished.
Markel made a pretense of paying the bill but allowed
his young friend to settle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>“Say, but you are pretty well fixed,” he said, as he
eyed Hockley’s roll of bills. “I wish I could say as
much for myself.”</p>

<p>“I’ve only got about a hundred dollars here,” answered
the lank youth, carelessly. “But I can get
the other when I want it.”</p>

<p>“Did you have to put it in the professor’s care?”</p>

<p>“No, he wanted it, but I told him I could take
care of it. I left it in my valise.”</p>

<p>“But somebody may go through your valise.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. Besides, the money is under
a false bottom in the valise. You can’t open it
unless you touch a spring on the side.”</p>

<p>“I see. That’s a handy thing. Well, let us be
going, or it will be time to return before we’ve seen
anything at all.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care when I get back, Markel. I can
tell the professor that my friends kept me all night.”</p>

<p>“Of course you can. Say, would you like to see
a real out-and-out cock fight? There is going to be
one to-night, in the rear of the Horn of Gold saloon.
The hotel keeper was telling me about it. He put
up five bolivars on one of the birds. All the best
sports in town will be there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>“All right, let’s go—unless there’s a bull fight
on somewhere,” answered Hockley.</p>

<p>“No bull fight to-night, Hockley. But that cock
fight will be a cooler, I can assure you. One of the
birds belongs to a Spanish millionaire, and the other
to one of the native generals in the army. We will
strike some high-toned people at the fight sure.”</p>

<p>The prospect of going to a place where he would
meet the “dead game” sports of Caracas pleased
Hockley, and he already fancied how he would
“blow” about the affair when he got back among
his old cronies at home. “I’ll meet the bon-tons,”
he said to himself. “It’s a good deal better than
going to see a dried-up old coffee plantation.”</p>

<p>They were soon on the way, down one broad street
and then into a side road which was little better
than an alleyway. At the end of the road stood a
ramshackle building dimly lit. Over the door hung
a gilded horn of plenty, giving to the resort its name,
Horn of Gold.</p>

<p>Entering the drinking room they found a crowd
of thirty or forty assembled, of various nationalities,
some black and some white, with two or three of
Indian blood. At the rear a negro was strumming a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
guitar and another was singing at the top of his
lungs, in order to make himself heard. But the
clanking of glasses and the loud talking all but
drowned out the music, if such it can be called.</p>

<p>To a youth of good habits the surroundings would
have been disgusting to the last degree. But Hockley
took them in as “part of the game,” and said
nothing. Yet the thick tobacco smoke made him
dizzy, and he dropped his own cigar when Markel
was not looking.</p>

<p>Hockley was at a disadvantage, since he could not
speak a word of the language. He listened attentively
for some English, but none was spoken.</p>

<p>“Sit down here while I learn the particulars of
this fight,” said the man from Baltimore, and motioned
him to a seat in a corner, near the guitar
player. Then Markel went off, not to re-appear for
ten minutes.</p>

<p>“It’s all right—I’ve got two tickets, but I had to
pay six bolivars for them,” said the man, on returning.
“Come this way.”</p>

<p>They passed through a dark passageway and into
a small enclosure without a roof. There were several
rows of benches around a boarded-up ring in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
center. Half a dozen smoky lamps lit up this fighting
pit, as it was termed.</p>

<p>“One bird is called the King and the other Favorita,”
said Markel. “The odds are on the King.
I’m going to lay a few bolivars on him.”</p>

<p>“Do the same for me,” said Hockley and passed
over some silver coins. He was so dizzy from smoking
and drinking that he could scarcely remember
what the coins were worth.</p>

<p>Markel made the bets, and soon the place began
to fill with the sports who had come to see the fight.
None of those who came in were the least bit “high-toned”
in appearance, much to Hockley’s chagrin,
nor did he behold a single military uniform, although
he had expected to see a number.</p>

<p>“Must be an off night,” said Markel. “Here,
have another cigar. I see you have finished the
other.”</p>

<p>He insisted upon Hockley smoking, and by the
time the cocks were brought in to fight the youth
was so dizzy he could scarcely see. The place was
filled with smoke, the crowd talked, laughed, cheered
and hissed, and oaths were by no means lacking. In
the midst of it all the birds fought until one was so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
badly wounded that it died shortly afterwards and
the other was almost equally mutilated. And yet
some people call such cruelty sport! It is not sport
at all, simply an exhibition of brutality, the same as
bull baiting and prize fighting.</p>

<p>“What did you say? Is it over?” asked Hockley,
trying to rouse himself from a sudden sickening
stupor into which he had fallen.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s over and our bird wasn’t in it,” replied
Markel. “What did you think of it?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t see much, on account of the poor
lights and the tobacco smoke.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the light was beastly. But it was a gamey
fight, I can tell you that. Come on.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t see many of the fashionables,” was
Hockley’s comment.</p>

<p>“No. I was told there is a ball on somewhere
to-night and they must have gone there. Let us go
into the saloon and have a drink.”</p>

<p>There was a crowd in the dark passageway and
Hockley found himself pushed first to one side and
then another. Markel was beside him, and the hands
of the man from Baltimore went into first one pocket
of the youth’s clothes and then another.</p>

<p>As soon as they had reached the drinking place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
Dan Markel insisted upon treating his companion
liberally. Then he settled the score and went out to
order a carriage to take them to the hotel.</p>

<p>In such a condition that he could scarcely walk,
poor, deluded Hockley was assisted to the turnout
and Markel climbed in beside him. It was now
after midnight.</p>

<p>“Say!” cried Hockley, suddenly. “My watch
is gone!”</p>

<p>“Your watch?” ejaculated the man from Baltimore,
in well assumed surprise. “Are you certain?”</p>

<p>“Course I’m certain—it’s gone—best gold watch,”
muttered Hockley, feeling into his various pockets
with difficulty.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you dropped it in the carriage,” went
on Markel, pretending to make a search. “It don’t
seem to be here.”</p>

<p>“Some of those rascals at the cock fight robbed
me,” groaned Hockley. He dove into his vest
pockets. “Say! my money’s gone too!”</p>

<p>“You don’t say!” cried Markel. “That is bad
and no mistake. You must have run afoul of a regular
thief. Is there anybody you suspect?”</p>

<p>“Can’t say as there is. There was a nigger got
pretty close to me just after the fight ended.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>“Then he must be the man. Shall we go back?”</p>

<p>“If he robbed me it ain’t likely he’s around now,”
groaned Hockley. He gave a deep yawn. “Hang
the luck anyway! Say, I feel awfully tired, I do.”</p>

<p>His eyes closed and although he tried to keep
awake in a few minutes he was fast asleep. Dan
Markel eyed him curiously.</p>

<p>“He was easier game than I thought of striking,”
said the man from Baltimore to himself. “A gold
watch and about a hundred dollars in cash. That’s
not so bad. Wonder what I had best do with him?”</p>

<p>The carriage rolled on, and as it covered the distance
to the Hotel Ziroda, Dan Markel revolved the
situation in his mind. As the turnout came to a stop
a peculiar light flashed in the rascal’s dark eyes.</p>

<p>“Might as well go the whole thing while I am at
it,” he said to himself. “I won’t be able to hoodwink
that professor as I have this young fellow. If I can
get the rest of the money I can clear out, and they’ll
never be able to find me.”</p>

<p>He and the carriage driver assisted Hockley to
the ground, and then one of the hotel helpers came
forward and helped Markel get the youth to the
room which the man from Baltimore occupied. No
questions were asked, for such occurrences were not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
uncommon among those who patronized the Hotel
Ziroda.</p>

<p>“He will stay with me to-night,” said Markel.
“I will foot the bill whatever it is.”</p>

<p>Laying Hockley on the bed, Markel allowed him
to sleep there, while he himself took a nap in a chair
by the window. The youth lay in a stupor, snoring
loudly, and was still snoring when Markel roused
up at six o’clock.</p>

<p>“My friend wishes you to send around to his
hotel for his traveling bag,” said the man from Baltimore
to the clerk in the office. “Here is his card.
If Professor Strong is there, tell him that Mr.
Hockley wishes to get a souvenir from the bag to
give to his friend who is to sail to-day.”</p>

<p>A messenger was sent off, and while he was gone
Dan Markel walked around anxiously. He was half
afraid Professor Strong would accompany the messenger
on the return, in which case it would perhaps
be best for him to leave by a back way and without
notice to anybody.</p>

<p>The messenger was gone fully half an hour, but
when he returned he was alone, much to Markel’s
relief. He had Hockley’s valise and turned it over
to the man from Baltimore without question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>When Markel re-entered the bed chamber the
poor fellow was stirring uneasily. But he did not
awaken and the rascal easily obtained from his
pocket the key to the traveling bag. Then the bag
was opened and Markel began a search for the
hidden spring.</p>

<p>At last it was found, and the false bottom flew
up, revealing a pocket containing a flat pocketbook.
Hastily opening the wallet Markel saw that it was
filled with bank bills and gold to the amount of several
hundred dollars.</p>

<p>“I’ve got it!” he muttered, his eyes glistening.
He closed the bag, locked it, and placed the wallet
in his own clothing. For a moment he hesitated,
then kicked the bag under the bed and hurried to
the door. As he passed out Hockley gave a long-drawn
sigh, turned over and went to sleep again.</p>

<p>Once in the corridor, Dan Markel paused and
looked around. Nobody was in sight, and watching
his chance, he made his way to a side entrance of
the hotel and from there into the street. Then he
hurried on, down the square, and out of sight.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p142.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">“I’ve got it,” he muttered.</p>

<small>SOMETHING ABOUT COFFEE GROWING</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I feel</span> like a new boy,” remarked Mark, on the
morning following the arrival at Enrique Morano’s
plantation. “I slept like a top last night.”</p>

<p>“So did I,” answered Frank. “That bed just
suited me. Wonder if anybody is stirring yet?”</p>

<p>“They must be. I just heard Bulo singing. What
a sweet voice that darkey has.”</p>

<p>The boys were soon dressed and out in the courtyard,
where the professor and the others presently
joined them.</p>

<p>“We will have a regular American breakfast,”
said Enrique Morano. “Usually my countrymen
have nothing but a cup of coffee and a roll on rising,
but I dropped that habit when I stopped in the United
States.”</p>

<p>“I noticed the coffee and rolls at the hotel,” said
Darry. “They are not very substantial.”</p>

<p>Breakfast was soon served, of cantelopes, tapioca,
fish, rice cakes, rolls, and coffee and to it all did full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
justice. The cantelopes were particularly fine and
fairly melted in the boys’ mouths.</p>

<p>“I must go to the University in an hour,” said
Señor Morano. “But I have arranged for Greva,
my head steward, to take you all over the place and
explain whatever you desire to know. Greva speaks
very good English. I will be with you again at four
this afternoon, and then, if you wish, I will take
you off on a horseback ride into the country.”</p>

<p>“We were thinking of getting back to Caracas
this afternoon,” said Professor Strong.</p>

<p>“No, no, you must not think of it, my dear
Strong!” cried the civil engineer. “I will not listen.
You must remain to-night at least. I have so much
I wish to talk about to you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let us stay!” whispered Darry. “I’m just
aching for a good horseback ride.”</p>

<p>“Yes, let us stay!” chimed in the others, and the
professor could not resist the appeal.</p>

<p>“But what of Hockley?” he said. “He will be
wondering what became of us.”</p>

<p>“Send him a letter to come out,” suggested Mark.
And this was done, the letter being carried to the
city by Enrique Morano himself.</p>

<p>Immediately after Enrique Morano had departed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
the steward, Juan Greva, who had been already introduced,
came forward, and conducted them from
the house to the nursery attached to the place.</p>

<p>“This is where we first grow our coffee plants,”
he said, in a strong Spanish accent. “We sow the
seeds in the ground and let the plant come up until
it is about a foot high before we transplant it to the
field.”</p>

<p>“And how long does it take for them to grow as
high as that?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>“About a year and a half. Then they are set out
in the field, which is first ploughed thoroughly and
planted with banana trees to shade the plants. Later
on we plant bucuara trees instead of the bananas, as
they are more hardy. If the coffee plants were not
shaded like that they might dry up.”</p>

<p>“Do they bear at once?” questioned Darry.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, far from it. They sometimes bear a
little the fourth or fifth year, but give nothing like a
regular crop until the seventh or eighth year.”</p>

<p>“Gracious, what a time to wait!” murmured
Frank.</p>

<p>“That is true, Newton,” said the professor. “But
after a plantation is once started it will last fifty
years or more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>“One plantation here has lasted seventy-five
years,” said Juan Greva. “It yields 1,200 quintals
of coffee a season, and the plantation is worth $60,000
of United States money.”</p>

<p>“How much is a quintal?” came from Frank.</p>

<p>“One hundred and twenty-five pounds,” answered
the professor. “1,200 quintals would be how much,
Newton?”</p>

<p>“150,000 pounds, sir,” answered Frank, after a
short mental calculation.</p>

<p>“Correct. Now, Robertson, at $15 per hundred
pounds, what is such a crop worth?”</p>

<p>“The crop is worth $22,500,” answered Mark,
after another pause.</p>

<p>“Gracious, there must be money in raising
coffee!” exclaimed Sam.</p>

<p>“Do they get fifteen cents a pound for this?”
questioned Darry.</p>

<p>“The market price at present is about sixteen
cents,” answered Juan Greva. “It runs from ten
cents to twenty-two cents.”</p>

<p>“You must remember, boys, that what is received
for the coffee is not pure gain. The plants have to
be cared for constantly and there is much to do before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
the bean is ready for the market. All such labor
has to be paid for.”</p>

<p>From the nursery they walked to the coffee grove
itself, a long and broad field, laid out into squares,
with ditches of water flowing between. The plants
were set out in rows, with many banana and bucuara
trees between.</p>

<p>“The coffee plants blossom in September,” said
the steward, as they walked through the field. “The
blossoms are something like orange blossoms, which
your ladies love to use at weddings. Then comes
the berry, which is something like a red cherry and
is picked in April and May. The picking is a great
time and men, women and children take part, each
with a basket on his or her back. A good picker
can pick berries enough in one day to make forty
to fifty pounds of coffee.”</p>

<p>Going into one of the storehouses, the steward
brought out some of the half-dried berries and broke
them open. Inside rested the seed, two coffee beans
with the flat sides together and covered with a sticky
pulp.</p>

<p>“Don’t look much like the beans we get,” said
Frank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>“These beans have to be dried and the pulp must
be taken off,” said the professor.</p>

<p>“How do they get the pulp off?” asked Mark.</p>

<p>“The berry is first crushed and then the mass
is put through a machine which separates the pulp
from the seeds. Then the seeds, or beans, are washed
twice and dried, and come out as white as anyone
would wish.”</p>

<p>“But our coffee isn’t white,” said Frank. “It’s
green—that is, before it is roasted.”</p>

<p>“The whiteness is all on the skin of the bean,
which must be taken off before the coffee is ready
for market. Did you notice that large stone flooring
on the other side of this field? That is the drying
floor.” The professor turned to the steward. “How
long do you dry your coffee here?”</p>

<p>“From six weeks to two months,” answered Juan
Greva. “The weather makes the time short or long.
Each day the coffee is spread out with rakes and at
night it is gathered in heaps and covered with heavy
cloth.”</p>

<p>“What a lot of work for a cup of coffee!” murmured
Mark.</p>

<p>“The work does not stop there,” said the steward
with a smile. “When the coffee is dry it goes into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
a machine which takes off the shell and then into
another machine which blows it perfectly clean. After
that it goes to the sorting room, where the girls
separate the good beans from the bad and grade the
good into five grades.”</p>

<p>“And then what?” came from Sam.</p>

<p>“Then the coffee is placed in bags and sewed up—that
is, the coffee which goes to the United States
and England. When you get it, it is roasted and
ground.”</p>

<p>“And then we take it and boil it, and strain it,
and put milk and sugar to it, and drink it down,
and that’s the end of it,” broke in Darry. “What
a lot to do just for one cup of coffee! I never
dreamed of such work before.”</p>

<p>“There is something else that is done with coffee,
though not here,” said Professor Strong. “In
Brazil they often paint coffee black for the South
African market, and in other places coffee is polished
so that it shines like silver. Every country has its
peculiar taste and the dealer must do his best to suit
that taste or lose the trade.”</p>

<p>After walking through the coffee grove, they
turned back to the warehouses, and Juan Greva explained
the various tools at hand for caring for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
plants. “The coffee bush is a hardy one, but must
be carefully watched if we wish to get the best results,”
he said. “It must have enough water but
not too much, and we must be careful of grubs and
worms.”</p>

<p>It was now growing warm, and the whole party
was glad enough to retire to the shelter of a palm
grove behind the warehouses. On two sides of the
grove were long rows of fruit trees with bushes of
various kinds of berries growing between. They sat
down and a servant presently appeared with a pitcher
of iced lemonade and a platter of little cakes covered
with honey.</p>

<p>“This looks like a land of plenty,” said Mark,
leaning back on a bench and taking a deep breath.
“How fresh and green everything is! It seems to
me a man ought to be able to make a living without
half trying.”</p>

<p>“The trouble down here has been the constant
revolutions,” answered the professor. “Nothing
has been safe, and nobody felt like settling down to
steady work. But that will pass away in time, and
then South America will take a leap forward that
will astonish those living in the North.”</p>

<small>DARRY’S WILD RIDE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Promptly</span> at four o’clock Enrique Morano returned
from the University. He found our friends
taking it easy in the patio, in hammocks which Juan
Greva had had strung there, under the giant palm.</p>

<p>“That is right, take it comfortably,” he said, with
a smile. “I am glad to see it. It is so hard to get
the Yankees to rest a little. They want constantly
to be on the go—to do something—to keep their
brain at work. Here, in this warm climate, it would
kill a man to keep at such a pace.”</p>

<p>“It does make one lazy,” returned Darry, as he
sat up. “But you won’t find me lazy when I get in
the saddle.”</p>

<p>“Then you love to ride?”</p>

<p>“He’s crazy for a horse,” put in Mark. “You
see, his father is a big cattle dealer from Chicago,
and Darry has been out on the ranches more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
once. I believe you once helped to break a bronco,
didn’t you, Darry?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then I will have to provide you with an animal
of spirit,” said Enrique Morano, with another smile.
“Very well, you shall have such a one.”</p>

<p>“No, no, don’t give him a fiery, untamed steed,
Morano,” interrupted Professor Strong. “Remember
I am responsible for his well-being while we are
in Venezuela.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want an old—plug,” said Darry,
with a crestfallen look. “If the horse is broken
I’d like to ride him even if he has some ginger in
him. Father lets me ride what I please at home.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll take a look at the horse first,” answered
Professor Strong, slowly. “As to ‘plugs,’ as you
term them, I don’t think our host keeps any such.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t mean to insinuate that he did,” said
Darry, hastily.</p>

<p>They walked down to the long, low stable and
the head hostler brought forth a number of the
horses. Enrique Morano pointed out a big bay.</p>

<p>“That is the fellow,” he said. “I can ride him,
but he may prove too much for you.”</p>

<p>“Let me try him,” pleaded Darry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>The bay was saddled, and the youth leaped up,
whip in hand. The horse pranced about a bit but
soon set off at an easy gait. The step is called the
<i>trote de paseo</i>, and is natural to the steeds in all
upper South America.</p>

<p>“Why he’s easy,” sang out the boy, after riding
up and down the horse yard and out to the highway
and back. “I am sure I won’t have a bit of trouble
with him.”</p>

<p>“He rides with confidence and well,” observed
Enrique Morano. “He ought to have no trouble on
the road.”</p>

<p>The matter was talked over, and finally Darry
was allowed to ride the bay horse, which rejoiced in
the name of <i>El Montero</i>—The Huntsman. The
others were quickly provided with steeds, and a little
later they left the plantation, Enrique Morano leading
the way on a favorite black.</p>

<p>For a long distance the road was level and they
moved off in a close bunch. Every one of the party
had learned to ride years before, so there was no
delay on that score. Mark and Frank wanted to race,
but the professor would not hear of it.</p>

<p>Presently they crossed a heavy stone bridge, bearing
this inscription:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span></p>

<p class="center">THE ILLUSTRIOUS AMERICAN,<br />
<span class="large">GENERAL ANTONIO GUZMAN BLANCO,</span><br />
PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC,<br />
HAD THIS BRIDGE ERECTED FOR<br />
THE PUBLIC GOOD.</p>

<p>“What a funny inscription,” observed Sam, as
he stopped to read it aloud.</p>

<p>“General Antonio Guzman Blanco doesn’t want
himself forgotten,” laughed Mark. “I have seen
a dozen monuments with his name on them, and at
least two dozen of his portraits.”</p>

<p>“He was a great man in his day,” said Enrique
Morano, gravely. “A very great man. He made
many improvements, such as building schools and
libraries, making highways and waterworks, and
bringing order out of disorder. But it would have
been better had he not advertised himself quite so
extensively.”</p>

<p>“That’s just it,” said Frank, and added, under
his breath to Darry: “You’d think he was trying
to advertise some special brand of Stomach Bitters,
wouldn’t you?” And Darry had to bite his lip to
keep from laughing outright.</p>

<p>“There isn’t half left of President Guzman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
Blanco’s monuments that there once was,” said Professor
Strong. “After his downfall, and after the
people became convinced that he was negotiating
with foreign powers against their good, they took
revenge by pulling down many of his statues, destroying
his portraits and renaming many of the
streets and parks christened in his honor. His fine
plantation was ruined, and even the State that bore
his name was re-named Miranda.”</p>

<p>Across the bridge the road ascended a slight hill
and then passed through an avenue of tropical trees
beautiful beyond description. Birds were numerous
and their music added to the delight of the riders.</p>

<p>“It’s like a bit of paradise!” said Sam, as he drew
rein, with Mark beside him. “Just look at that
scenery. Did you ever behold anything so beautiful?
See yonder waterfall, how it glistens in the
sunshine and how gracefully the vines fall over the
rocks beside it! What a spot for a painter!”</p>

<p>The others had also halted, all but Darry, who was
secretly itching to “let the bay out,” as he told himself.
Now he saw his chance and away he went,
before either Professor Strong or Enrique Morano
noticed him. There was a turn a hundred yards
ahead, and this gained, Darry whipped up the bay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
and away they went up the hill and down the opposite
side at a break-neck speed, the boy urging the
horse on at every step.</p>

<p>“This is what I call riding! Whoop!” he called
out. “Get up there, Huntsman, get up, I say!”</p>

<p>Soon he was out of sight and hearing of the others
and still tearing along at a gait which was truly astonishing.
But the bay acted well and he had small
difficulty in keeping his seat. Indeed, he thought the
riding even easier than some he had experienced
while in our own west.</p>

<p>The downward slope of the hill left behind, Darry
found himself confronted by a fork of the road.
There was small time to decide and he took the
branch to the south, as that looked more traveled
than the other. But he had hardly gone a hundred
yards before he noticed that the highway was somewhat
cut up, as if some improvements were underway.</p>

<p>A short distance further on he came across a gang
of native workmen, armed with picks, spades and
shovels. They were digging a trench beside the road
and some of them shouted to him as he rode past, but
he did not understand a word they said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>“Can’t stop me to-day, thank you!” he shouted
back pleasantly, and urged on his steed as before.</p>

<p>The road now made another turn, among a mass
of rocks and brushwood. Here it crossed a narrow
rocky stream, where the water ran swiftly. The
bridge was out of repair and the workmen were engaged
in putting up a permanent stone structure to
take its place.</p>

<p>“Go back! Go back!” shouted a foreman of the
laborers, in Spanish. “Go back!” And he rushed
forward to stop Darry’s horse. But before he could
do so, the youth was past him and riding on the old
bridge, which sagged and trembled beneath the
sudden weight.</p>

<p>“Gracious, this won’t do,” thought the boy, and
tried to get the horse over the bridge with all possible
speed.</p>

<p>He had just reached the end when there came a
loud explosion, as terrifying as it was unexpected.
The workmen were engaged in blasting rocks which
stood in the way of the new bridge and had just set
off a charge of dynamite. They had tried to warn
him to go back, but he had not understood them.</p>

<p>As the explosion came horse and rider were lifted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
into the air for several feet and before they landed
again, each was struck by the shattered stone, which
flew in all directions. The bay came down on his
knees, throwing Darry over his head into the stream
beneath the bridge. Then with a wild plunge the
frightened steed went on, leaving the boy to his
fate.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>A TALK ABOUT BEASTS AND SNAKES</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Darry</span> has gone on ahead,” observed Mark,
looking down the road.</p>

<p>“He’s off for a ride now!” cried Sam. “My,
see him go!”</p>

<p>“He is foolish to ride so fast in this sun,” said
the professor, half angrily. “Darry, come back!”</p>

<p>But the call did not reach the flying youth, and he
was soon out of sight. Scarcely had he disappeared
when Enrique Morano gave a start.</p>

<p>“We must stop him,” he ejaculated. “We must
stop him before it is too late.”</p>

<p>“Too late?” came from the others in alarm.</p>

<p>“Yes, too late. Below here are two roads and
he may take the wrong one and go to the old bridge,
which is worn out and not safe.”</p>

<p>“Come!” The word came from the professor and
without ado he urged his horse forward at twice the
speed they had formerly employed. Enrique Morano<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
rode beside him and the boys brought up closely in
the rear.</p>

<p>About half the distance to the old bridge was covered
when the noise of the explosion reached their
ears. Professor Strong gazed inquiringly at his old
college friend.</p>

<p>“What can that mean, Morano?”</p>

<p>“They are working on the new bridge and are
blasting rocks there. I trust the workmen warned
the youth—if he took that road.”</p>

<p>It was not long before they came upon the first
of the workmen and the civil engineer questioned
them.</p>

<p>“Yes, he came this way,” said Enrique Morano,
to the professor. “One man says he must have been
right on the old bridge when the blast occurred.”</p>

<p>“Pray heaven he is safe!” murmured Professor
Strong, his face paling slightly.</p>

<p>When they reached the old bridge they found the
workmen running down to the water’s edge.</p>

<p>“He is here!” cried the foreman, to Morano.
“His horse ran away and threw him. The blast was
too much for the beast.”</p>

<p>“Where is the boy?” demanded the professor,
and having the direction pointed out to him, leaped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
to the rocks and ran forward to the edge of the
stream.</p>

<p>Darry lay on his back, partly in and partly out of
the water. His eyes were closed and he was motionless.</p>

<p>“Poor boy, he looks as if he were dead!”</p>

<p>“No, no, don’t say that Darry is dead!” cried
Frank, who had come up by this time. “Perhaps
he’s only unconscious.”</p>

<p>No one replied to this, but all rushed boldly into
the stream. Soon they had raised the body up and
carried it to a patch of grass under a tree. The
professor got down on his knees to make an examination.</p>

<p>“He is alive!” he murmured, after a painful
pause. “I believe he has only been stunned.”</p>

<p>As he finished speaking Darry gave a shudder and
opened his eyes.</p>

<p>“Whoa!” he murmured. “Whoa!” and then
closed his eyes and gave a shiver.</p>

<p>“You are safe now, my boy,” said the professor.
“Take it easy. You are safe.”</p>

<p>At last Darry opened his eyes again and gave a
gasp.</p>

<p>“Wha—what does this mean?” he questioned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
slowly, and then put his hand to his side and gave a
groan.</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember the explosion?” asked
Mark. “The horse must have thrown you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I remember now. Is the—the horse
all right?”</p>

<p>“Never mind the horse,” put in Enrique Morano.
“I sincerely trust you are not seriously injured.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a pain in my side, but I guess it won’t
amount to much,” answered Darry and attempted
to sit up. But the effort was too much and he sank
back again.</p>

<p>“Rest as you are,” said the professor, kindly.
“We will get a carriage to take you back to the
plantation.”</p>

<p>“To be sure. I will go for the carriage myself,”
said Enrique Morano, and leaping into the saddle
again he dashed down the highway with the best
speed his steed could attain.</p>

<p>While Enrique Morano was gone Professor
Strong made an examination of Darry. As a hunter
and traveler he had had considerable experience in
caring for the wounded and he soon learned that no
bones were broken. The youth was simply bruised
and in a few days would be as well as ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>One of the workmen on the road had gone after
the runaway horse and now returned, leading the
bay, which was covered with foam and dust. The
steed trembled with excitement and pranced around
continuously.</p>

<p>It was half an hour before Enrique Morano appeared,
driving the largest carriage of which his
plantation boasted. Into this Darry was lifted carefully
and Professor Strong rode beside him, to save
him as much as possible from being jounced around.</p>

<p>“I have sent a servant for a doctor,” said the civil
engineer. “He will probably be at the house as soon
as ourselves,” and such proved to be a fact.</p>

<p>By nightfall Darry found himself lying on a cool
and comfortable bed. A bruise on his head was
bound up in a white bandage and there was another
bandage over his hip. As the boy was naturally
strong and healthy the physician said that medicine
for him would be unnecessary.</p>

<p>“I’m glad he didn’t make me take a big dose of
something nasty,” said Darry to Frank. “Some
doctors do that, you know, just to let you think
they are earning their fee,” and Frank had to smile
at this, it was so much like his chum’s way of looking
at things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>Under the circumstances it was impossible for the
party to leave the plantation, and after some talk
Professor Strong decided to accept Enrique Morano’s
invitation to remain there until the following
Monday.</p>

<p>“That will give Hockley a chance to see the coffee
plantation and learn how coffee is raised,” said the
professor. “I will go and bring him while you
boys remain with Crane.”</p>

<p>“It’s queer Hockley hasn’t come along on his own
account,” said Mark. “His friends must be off by
this time.”</p>

<p>“I know of no steamer sailing to-day,” put in
Enrique Morano, who stood near. “His friends
must be going on some sailing vessel.”</p>

<p>“Have you a list of the sailings?” asked Professor
Strong, quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes, in the newspaper of yesterday. Here it is.”</p>

<p>The professor took the paper and read the list with
care. As Morano had said there was no sailing of
any steamer. The sailing vessels to leave were two
in number, one bound for Cape Town, South Africa
and the other bound for Rio Janeiro, Brazil.</p>

<p>“I thought his friends were bound for Philadelphia,”
mused Professor Strong, and said no more.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
But his eyes took on a speculative look as though he
feared Hockley had not told the exact truth in the
note which had been sent.</p>

<p>Dinner that evening was quite an elaborate affair
and lasted fully an hour. When it was over, Enrique
Morano insisted upon going into town with the
professor.</p>

<p>“I am certain you boys can amuse yourselves
while we are gone,” he said, to Mark and the others.
“Make yourselves at home. There are books and a
piano, and in the corner are several portfolios of
pictures to look over.”</p>

<p>“All right, I guess we’ll put in the time pleasantly
enough,” was Mark’s answer, and soon the two
men were gone and the boys found themselves alone,
excepting for the servants that remained within call
to wait on them.</p>

<p>The portfolios of pictures proved of great interest
to all but Darry, who soon fell into a sound sleep,
from which the others did not awaken him. In the
collection of pictures were views of the great Cathedral
at Caracas, the numerous Public Buildings, the
Botanical Gardens, the wonderful railroad bridges
around the mountains and over the valleys, the harbors
at La Guayra, the waterways leading to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
mighty Orinoco, and views of the great river itself,
showing the canyons to be found in certain localities
and the fierce rapids. The latter views interested
them most of all.</p>

<p>“I’m just aching to get on that river,” said Frank.
“What fun we will have, hunting, fishing and camping
out! The cities are all well enough, but one gets
tired of them after awhile.”</p>

<p>“We haven’t seen so very much of the cities yet,”
put in Sam.</p>

<p>“We’ve done up Caracas, and that’s the main city.
And we stopped at La Guayra, which is as important
a seacoast town as they have.”</p>

<p>“I’m with Frank on the river question,” said
Mark. “I hope I get a shot at some big game.”</p>

<p>“The professor thinks there is no large game left
in Venezuela,” said Sam. “He said there were a
number of animals of the cat variety like the puma,
ounce and ocelot.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard there were jaguars here—in the big
forests.”</p>

<p>“The professor said there might be some but they
were becoming very rare. You see, the people who
have immense herds of cattle on the <i>llanos</i>, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
prairies, have to protect their stock and so they have
hunted the wild beasts pretty thoroughly.”</p>

<p>“I know other things they have, which we may
fall in with, and they are just as bad as big game and
maybe worse,” said Mark.</p>

<p>“What are they?” asked Frank, with increased
interest.</p>

<p>“Alligators, rattlesnakes and boa-constrictors.”</p>

<p>“Ugh!” came from Sam, with a shiver. “Deliver
me from a boa-constrictor. I saw one once in
a menagerie. They fed it on live rabbits and the
sight was enough to make one sick.”</p>

<p>“The professor says the rattlesnakes are more to
be feared than anything,” went on Mark. “He says
the alligators and the boa-constrictors generally
keep their distance, but the snakes strike you through
the tall grass before you can realize what is up. I
can tell you what, we’ll have to keep our eyes open
when we get down on the hunting ground.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>A BITTER DISCOVERY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hockley</span> sat up on the bed and stared around him
in stupid bewilderment. For the moment he could
realize nothing but that he had a bursting headache
and felt wretched all over.</p>

<p>“It was the drinking and smoking that did it,” he
thought and gave a low groan. “Oh, my head!”</p>

<p>For several minutes he sat almost motionless, trying
to collect his senses. Then he gazed around the
room and at last realized that he was in the apartment
which Dan Markel had engaged.</p>

<p>“Markel!” he called out. “Markel, where are
you?”</p>

<p>Receiving no answer, he dragged himself to his
feet. He was all in a tremble and soon sank down
in a chair by the barred window. He saw that the
sun was up and that the street was alive with people.</p>

<p>“It must be pretty late,” he muttered, and felt
for his watch to note the time. “Oh, I forgot. The
watch was stolen, and so was my roll of bills. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
is a pretty how-do-you-do, anyway. What will the
professor say when he hears of it? But I don’t
care—he ain’t my master, and I’m going to do as I
please.” He put his hand to his forehead. “Oh,
how everything spins!”</p>

<p>There was a wash basin and some water handy
and the lad bathed himself, after which he felt
slightly better. As he was re-arranging his collar
and tie he began to wonder what had become of his
friend.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he has gone to hunt up my watch and
money,” he thought. “Hope he gets them. Dad
will be awful mad over that watch, I know. He
cautioned me to be careful of it when he gave it to
me.”</p>

<p>Hockley waited for quarter of an hour longer and
then, out of patience, rang for an attendant.</p>

<p>“Where is Mr. Markel?” he asked. “See if you
can find him.”</p>

<p>“<i>Si, señor</i>,” said the servant, who understood a
little English and was kept to wait on Americans.</p>

<p>After the man was gone Hockley sat down by
the window again and gave himself up to his reflections.
They were far from pleasant.</p>

<p>“That cock fight was a fizzle,” he muttered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
“Markel must take me for a fool to cart me off to
such a place. I’ve a good mind to tell him so, too,
when he comes. If he can’t take me to better places
than that I’ll cut him.”</p>

<p>Hockley’s head continued to ache, and the quarter
of an hour he had to wait ere the servant returned
seemed an age to him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Markel cannot be found, <i>señor</i>,” was the report.
“I have searched all over the place, but it is of
no use.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t in the dining room?”</p>

<p>“No <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>“Did you see him go out?”</p>

<p>“I did not, <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t leave any word at the office?”</p>

<p>“He did not, <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>“It’s mighty queer what has become of him. I’ll
go out and look for him myself.”</p>

<p>Leaving the apartment Hockley strolled into the
office and took a look up and down the hot street and
then into the wine-room. Of course he saw nothing
of the man from Baltimore, who was now miles
away. Much bewildered but still unsuspicious he
went back to the office.</p>

<p>“He must have gone away shortly after you sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
for your bag,” said the hotel keeper, who also spoke
English.</p>

<p>“After I sent for my bag?” repeated Hockley.
“I sent for no bag.”</p>

<p>“No?” The hotel keeper looked astonished.
“He said you wished it, and we sent a boy after it.
He took it to your room.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen the bag,” answered Hockley, and
then his heart sank suddenly within him, for he remembered
telling Markel of the secret compartment.
What if the man from Baltimore had played him
false?</p>

<p>“The bag must be in your room,” went on the
hotel man stoutly. “I saw it carried in myself.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go and look,” returned the lank youth and
almost ran back to the apartment. At first he failed
to locate the valise but presently discovered it under
the bed and hauled it forth.</p>

<p>“Robbed! Every cent gone!” The cry came
straight from Hockley’s heart, and trembling from
head to foot he sank into a chair, the picture of
misery and despair.</p>

<p>“You are robbed?” asked the hotel keeper, who
had followed him to the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>“Yes, robbed! That man has taken all of my
money.”</p>

<p>“But he was your friend!” ejaculated the other,
in bewilderment.</p>

<p>“He pretended to be my friend,” answered the
youth, bitterly. “I met him on the steamer from
New York. He was a stranger up to that time.”</p>

<p>“And an American! It is very sad, <i>señor</i>. What
will you do? Put the police on his track?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to do. I’m strapped—I
haven’t a dollar to my name.”</p>

<p>At this the brow of the hotel keeper darkened.</p>

<p>“Who then will pay your bill?” he asked sharply.</p>

<p>“My bill?”</p>

<p>“Yes, <i>señor</i>. I am a poor man, for the hotel business
is not very good this year. I cannot afford to
lose what is coming to me.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to lose it!” cried Hockley, angrily.
“I’ve been duped, don’t you understand? Cleaned
out. How can I pay you?”</p>

<p>“But you are with another party, at the big hotel.
They told me up there of it.”</p>

<p>“That’s true, but I’m not going to pay Markel’s
bill, I can tell you that,” snorted Hockley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>“If you do not pay I shall tell the police it is a
scheme to cheat me out of my money,” was the sullen
answer. “You have some baggage, that bag, I shall
hold it until I am paid. You shall not remove it.”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p172.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">“You have some baggage in that bag. I shall hold it.”</p>

<p>At this Hockley was horrified, feeling that he was
getting deeper and deeper into difficulty.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you any pity on a fellow who has been
cleaned out?” he pleaded.</p>

<p>“I am a poor man—I must have my money,” returned
the hotel keeper, stoutly.</p>

<p>“All right, you shall have it,” answered Hockley.
“But you’ll have to wait until I get back to the
other hotel and get the cash.”</p>

<p>“I will go with you,” answered the hotel keeper,
who was unwilling to trust the youth out of his sight.</p>

<p>Valise in hand Hockley tramped back to the hotel
at which our friends were stopping. He fully expected
to find Professor Strong and the others awaiting
him, and wondered what explanation he should
make concerning his plight.</p>

<p>When he learned that all were at the plantation
still he did not know whether to be glad or sorry.
He hunted out the hotel clerk and asked concerning
the professor and the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>“I would like to borrow a little money until they
get back,” he said. “Professor Strong will make
it good when he settles up.”</p>

<p>The money was at once forthcoming, and Hockley
settled up with the keeper of the Hotel Ziroda. He
would not pay for Markel, and the hotel man said he
would keep whatever had been left behind until the
bill was settled. But the man from Baltimore had
left little of value outside of a newspaper containing
some dirty linen.</p>

<p>It was a very crestfallen youth who slipped into the
dining room for breakfast and one who was in a
humor to eat but little. As he gulped down a cup of
coffee Hockley meditated on the situation. He
wanted to smooth matters over with Professor
Strong but did not see his way clear to doing it.</p>

<p>“I suppose I’ll have to face the music in the end,”
he thought, with a long sigh. “Oh, what a downright
fool I was, to be taken in so easily! If the
other fellows hear of it how they will laugh at me!”</p>

<p>When Professor Strong arrived in the evening he
saw at once that something out of the ordinary had
occurred. Hockley sat in his room, his head tied up
in a towel.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Hockley?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>“I’ve had bad luck, sir,” whined the youth.
“Awfully bad luck.”</p>

<p>“Why, how is that?”</p>

<p>“I fell in with that Dan Markel, sir—after I had
left those friends I mentioned in the note. Markel
is a villain. He induced me to go off with him last
night, and then he drugged and robbed me.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible! I did not like the looks of the man
when first we met on the steamer. But I thought
we left him behind at Curaçao.”</p>

<p>“He came on after us. He was a sly one, I can
tell you, sir. You know I said I wanted to see the
lumber yards, so that I could write to my father and
tell him how business was carried on here. Well, he
said he knew all about them and would show me
around. So I went with him after my friends sailed
and instead of showing me around he took me to
some kind of a hotel. I had some cocoa and it was
drugged and after that I didn’t know a thing until I
woke up at the Hotel Ziroda and found my watch
and money gone. And what was worse the villain
had sent for my valise and robbed that too.”</p>

<p>This mixture of truth and falsehood was told very
adroitly, and Professor Strong could not but believe
the tale. He hurried to the other hotel and interviewed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
the proprietor, and then notified the police
of what had occurred. An alarm was sent out and a
hunt made for Dan Markel, but the man from Baltimore
could not be found.</p>

<p>Professor Strong wished to know something about
the friends Hockley had met, but the youth pretended
to be too sick to talk. He had been clever
enough to look over the sailings in the newspaper
and said they had gone on the <i>Desdemona</i> to Rio
Janeiro, and were going from that port to Philadelphia.</p>

<p>As the youth seemed too sick to journey to the
plantation Professor Strong remained with him all
night, and Enrique Morano went back alone to carry
the news to the others.</p>

<p>“Humph! we are having all sorts of excitement,”
was Mark’s comment. “First it was myself, then it
was Darry, and now it’s Hockley. I wonder what
will happen next?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>BATHING AT MACUTO</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the time that Darry was ill, the others
took the railroad to Valencia and stopped half a day
in that ancient town, which is one of the most
picturesque in all of South America. They visited
Lake Valencia, lying far above sea level, and Enrique
Morano took them to a cathedral in the vicinity
where can be seen a number of rare religious paintings.
On the way back a stop was made at Victoria,
once the place where Bolivar lived and where a
great number of relics of the departed great man
are stored.</p>

<p>Darry’s sickness did not last, and inside of five
days he announced that he would be able to go anywhere.
“But I shan’t try to run away again on a
horse,” he added, with a rueful smile.</p>

<p>The boys had endeavored to question Hockley
about his experience with Dan Markel, but could
get no satisfaction. Once Hockley flew in a rage
at Sam over this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>“It’s my business, not yours,” he growled. “I
lost the money and the watch. You only want to
crow over me, but let me tell you, if you go too far
somebody will get a thrashing.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to crow at all, Hockley,” returned
Sam. “I thought that perhaps I might be able to
help you—if this Markel ever shows himself
again.”</p>

<p>“He won’t show himself—he’s too cute,” grumbled
the other. “Now you just keep quiet about it.”
And there the subject was dropped, so far as it
reached the injured one.</p>

<p>“He’s sore, no doubt of that,” said Frank to Sam,
when told of the conversation. “And I don’t blame
him. Just the same, I’ll wager he went off with
Markel to have a good time.”</p>

<p>“I think that too, Frank. Well, if he went too
far, he’s had to pay for it,” returned Sam.</p>

<p>All told, the stay at the coffee plantation had been
full of interest and the boys thanked Enrique Morano
over and over again for his kindness to them.</p>

<p>“If you ever come to New York we’ll do all we
can for you,” said Mark, heartily, and the others
spoke in a similar strain.</p>

<p>The next day found them back to Caracas and here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
they stopped but a few hours before taking a train
for La Guayra. Arriving at the seaport arrangements
were made for a side trip, so to speak, to the
Gulf and the Lake of Maracaibo, situated to the
westward. But the vessel was not to sail until two
days later, so while waiting they took a little run
over to Macuto, located not far from La Guayra.</p>

<p>“Macuto is the Bar Harbor, Asbury Park, and
Coney Island of Venezuela,” explained the professor,
while the party was on the way, along a highway
skirting the ocean. “It is only six miles from
the seaport, and is a great resort for the folks in
Caracas and La Guayra who wish to escape the extreme
heat of those towns. It gets a constant breeze
from the north and as a consequence is usually ten to
fifteen degrees more on the side of comfort.”</p>

<p>On arriving at Macuto the boys were somewhat
disappointed to find the greater part of the beach
highway given over to drinking places and general
stores, while the hotels were further up on the hills
behind the sand.</p>

<p>“Can’t we go in bathing?” asked Sam. It was
a sport he enjoyed exceedingly.</p>

<p>“Yes, there is a bathing spot, at the end of the
highway,” answered the professor, and thither they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
made their way. The bathing pavilion was built in
the shape of a castle, standing in the water at the
end of a long wharf.</p>

<p>The boys were soon inside, and each paid his
medio for a bathroom and the use of a towel. They
soon discovered that the men bathed in one place
and the women in another, and that but few suits
were used. But suits were to be had at an office
in a corner of the building and they procured these
and all went in, including the professor, who was an
excellent swimmer.</p>

<p>“Tell you what, this is something like!” cried
Sam, enthusiastically, as he splashed about and then
scooped some water up over Frank’s head. “Come
on, I’ll race you!”</p>

<p>“Done!” answered Frank, who was also a good
swimmer, and in another moment the two lads were
off, while a crowd, composed largely of natives,
watched them.</p>

<p>There was not much danger, as the bathing spot
is enclosed by rows of piling, over which the surf
booms constantly. The water was warm and clean.
The race was to the stone wall which divides the
men’s space from that of the women’s and both
reached the goal at the same time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>“A tie!” shouted Mark. “Better call it off,”
and they did and went in for diving and plunging
and “horse play” to their heart’s content. Even
Hockley seemed to thaw out over the fun and joined
in as readily as anybody.</p>

<p>After the bath the entire party paid a visit to
several of the leading hotels, stopping at one for a
shell-fish dinner which was as delicious as any they
had ever eaten. At the hotel was a native orchestra
playing operatic airs and popular songs. Seeing the
Americans the leader started his men to playing what
was then the popular song in New York. This
pleased Mark and Frank, and when a collection was
taken they did not forget to contribute.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” cried Hockley, as they were on the
point of leaving the hotel. “It’s him!”</p>

<p>“Him? Who?” asked Mark, who stood beside
the lank youth.</p>

<p>“Dan Markel. He just went into that store over
yonder!”</p>

<p>“Then you had better tell the professor and have
him arrested.”</p>

<p>“I will.”</p>

<p>Professor Strong was just settling their bill when
Hockley acquainted him with what he had seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>“To be sure, we must catch him,” he cried.
“Lead the way.”</p>

<p>Hockley set off on a run, with the professor beside
him, and the others bringing up the rear. Markel
had entered a <i>bodega</i>, or grocery, which were
numerous in that particular vicinity.</p>

<p>Markel was buying something in the shop when,
on glancing up, he saw Hockley rush in, followed
by Professor Strong and the others. They all made
directly for the fellow, who found himself surrounded
almost before he realized it.</p>

<p>“Give me my watch and that money,” ejaculated
Hockley, in quick rage, and caught the man from
Baltimore by the sleeve.</p>

<p>“Hullo, what’s the matter?” demanded the man,
trying to put on a bold front.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you what’s the matter,” blustered
Hockley. “Give me the watch and money I say.”</p>

<p>“You must be crazy. I haven’t anything belonging
to you.”</p>

<p>“And I say you have.”</p>

<p>“Hockley says that you robbed him while he was
in your company last week,” put in Professor
Strong. “I think you had better come with us to the
police station.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>“The boy doesn’t tell the truth. He drank too
much and got in a crowd, and when he came out his
money and watch were gone. I had nothing to do
with it.”</p>

<p>“I say it’s not so,” ejaculated Hockley, growing
red at being exposed. “You sent for my valise and
robbed that, too. I can prove you sent for it by the
proprietor of the Hotel Ziroda.”</p>

<p>At this shot Dan Markel grew pale. He felt that
he was cornered and that a visit to the police station
would do much to prove his guilt. He had left the
watch behind him, but he had Hockley’s money—or
the larger portion of it—on his person, and he did
not know but that some of the bills could be identified.</p>

<p>“It—it’s all a mistake,” he faltered.</p>

<p>“You come to the police station with us,” said
Professor Strong, quietly but sternly.</p>

<p>Dan Markel looked around. There seemed no
way of escape and his face fell.</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll go with you,” he said, although
he had no such intention. “But let me tell you that
you are making a big mistake, and that you’ll have a
suit for damages on your hands.”</p>

<p>“I’ll risk the suit,” returned the professor, grimly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>All marched out of the <i>bodega</i>, much to the astonishment
of the proprietor, who had not understood a
word of what was said. On the corner they paused.</p>

<p>“There ought to be a policeman somewhere——”
began Professor Strong, when without warning,
Dan Markel tore himself loose and leaped into the
street. Several carriages were passing and in a
twinkling he had darted between these and was
running for an alleyway not far distant.</p>

<p>“He’s running away!” burst out Hockley.
“Come on after him!” And he started to follow,
and so did the others. But the street was so crowded
that it took several seconds to gain the other side,
and by that time Markel was out of sight.</p>

<p>“I saw where he went,” said Mark. “Into the
alley way. Come on, Hockley.”</p>

<p>“I’m with you,” was the answer, and both boys
hurried on as fast as the condition of the thoroughfare
would permit.</p>

<p>Dan Markel was thoroughly alarmed, for he felt
that if he was captured Professor Strong would see
to it that he was given a long term of imprisonment.</p>

<p>“They shan’t get me this trip,” he muttered to
himself, and seeing a doorway open close at hand,
darted through this, into a large warehouse. From<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
the entrance he made his way among a number of
boxes and barrels to the rear. Beyond was another
alleyway and he leaped into this. With all the speed
left to him he managed in a few minutes to gain
the boulevard where the carriages ran between Macuto
and La Guayra. A vehicle containing only a
couple of passengers was passing and he leaped into
this.</p>

<p>“I wish to get to La Guayra as soon as possible,”
he said to the driver. “An extra bolivar for you if
you whip up your horses.”</p>

<p>“<i>Si, señor</i>,” was the answer, and the driver
cracked his whip. Away went the turnout; and that
was the last seen of Dan Markel for some time to
come.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br />

<small>A SHORT VOYAGE WESTWARD</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> days later found our friends on board a
steamer bound for the Gulf of Maracaibo. The
weather was all that could be desired, and for the
most part all were in excellent spirits, the single
exception being Hockley, who still mourned the loss
of his money and timepiece.</p>

<p>“It’s a shame we didn’t catch Dan Markel in Macuto,”
said the lank youth more than once. “I think
we might have done it if the professor hadn’t been
so slow to act.”</p>

<p>“We did all we could,” had been Mark’s answer.
“But that Markel is a mighty slick one, and we’ll
have to get up bright and early to corner him.”</p>

<p>Although the others did not know it, Professor
Strong had given Hockley a severe lecture on the
return to La Guayra, telling the youth of the folly
of associating with a man of Markel’s character,
and of the further foolishness of drinking and trying
to be a so-called sport.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>“You will ruin both your health and your character
by such actions,” the professor had said. “A
young man who will act in that fashion shows a lack
of common sense. I want no more of it.” And
though Hockley had felt strongly inclined to “talk
back” he had not had the courage to do so.</p>

<p>The steamer sailing from La Guayra to the Gulf
of Maracaibo made a stop at Curaçao, so that little
could be seen of the coast line between La Guayra
and Cape St. Roman, at the entrance to the gulf. The
stop at Willemstad was of short duration and nobody
of the party went ashore. Then the course
was straight around the cape into the gulf, which
is nothing less than an inlet of the Caribbean Sea,
seventy-five miles deep and about twice as broad.</p>

<p>The Gulf and the Lake of Maracaibo are connected
by an irregular strait twenty miles long and
five to ten miles wide. The lake itself is a hundred
miles long and three quarters that in width. It is
very deep, so that large vessels can sail on it almost
from end to end. But big vessels cannot get in or
out because the strait is shallow and filled with
shifting bars of sand.</p>

<p>“What a picturesque spot,” was Sam’s comment,
as the steamer made her landing at Maracaibo, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
is situated upon the strait. “And it looks as if they
did a big business here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, a very large business is done here,” answered
Professor Strong. “They export millions
of pounds of coffee and cocoa each year, besides
hides, cotton, and other articles of commerce.”</p>

<p>They were soon ashore and took a trip on the
street railways, which stretch a dozen miles or more
in various directions. On every side was the greatest
of activity, the wharves being as full of life as those
at New York city. There were electric lights and
telephones the same as at Caracas.</p>

<p>“They are up-to-date, that’s sure,” said Mark.
“Anybody who comes down here expecting to find
a howling wilderness will have his eyes opened.”</p>

<p>“The country would progress even more rapidly
were it not for many things beyond human control,”
returned the professor. “But the heat is at times
terrific and the fever lays many low, and then they
have had some awful earthquakes and tidal waves
here.”</p>

<p>After the ride the party visited various public
buildings and public parks, with their statues of
Bolivar, Guzman Blanco and other celebrities.</p>

<p>“We are now in the State of Zulia,” said Professor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
Strong, “and not over ninety miles from the
eastern boundary of Colombia. This State contains
about 100,000 inhabitants, of which 30,000 live in
this city. A good deal of the trade you see here
comes over the mountains from Colombia on mule back.
Several railroads are contemplated, and when
they are built Maracaibo will be one of the most important
points for shipping in the northern part of
South America.”</p>

<p>The party stopped for two days at Maracaibo,
visiting several towns in the vicinity, which, however,
were of small importance. On the second day
Frank proposed that they hire one of the native
boats for a short sail on the lake.</p>

<p>“Just so we can tell the folks at home that we
sailed on Lake Maracaibo,” he said.</p>

<p>“Hurrah, just the thing!” cried Sam. “I’d like
that first rate.”</p>

<p>The others were equally enthusiastic, and soon
a boat was procured, something similar to a sloop,
but with the sail running directly to the masthead.
A native was in charge who could speak a little
English, and he agreed to take them down the lake
for a distance of a dozen miles and bring them back
early in the evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>With a basket filled with good things procured at
their hotel, the party embarked at one of the long,
low piers, and soon the mainsail was set and they
were speeding away over the clear waters of the
lake at a rate of seven knots an hour. The craft was
a staunch built affair and minded her helm to perfection.</p>

<p>“I see you know how to handle her,” said Mark,
to the boatman, who rejoiced in the name of Salvador.</p>

<p>“<i>Si, señor,</i>” was the answer. “I been a boatman
since a little baby so big,” and Salvador smiled
broadly.</p>

<p>“What do you do with the boat, fish?”</p>

<p>“Fish when weather good, <i>señor</i>. When weather
no good carry cocoa and t’ings, or go to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Go to sleep is good,” laughed Frank. “That’s
one thing everybody down here seems able to do.”</p>

<p>Mark and Frank had purchased some fishing
tackle in the town and as they sailed they threw out
lines behind for trolling. Salvador showed them
how to bait up to the best advantage and soon Mark
found he had a bite. He hauled in without delay
and brought on deck a bass weighing all of a pound
and a half.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>“First haul!” he shouted, highly pleased.</p>

<p>“Here is another,” cried Frank, and brought in
an equally big fish. All examined the catches with
care but saw little difference from the fish caught
nearer home.</p>

<p>“Any electric eels here?” asked the professor of
the boatman.</p>

<p>“I have heard of a few but I never see them,
<i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>“Electric eels?” repeated Hockley. “Do they
come from Venezuela?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll find them in the Orinoco, Hockley,—big
ones too. We will have to be careful when we
go fishing there, unless we want to get a shock.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! I’m not afraid of an eel,” returned the
other. “I saw an electric eel once, in an aquarium
at Chicago, but he didn’t have much electricity in
him.”</p>

<p>“Then he must have been almost exhausted. A
strong healthy electric eel can give a man as much
of a shock as anybody wants, I can assure
you.”</p>

<p>Inside of two hours the boys had a string of ten
good sized fish, and then the professor told them
they had better stop the sport as it delayed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
progress of the boat. So the lines were hauled in,
after which they progressed faster than ever. A
stiff breeze was blowing and the sky was cloudless.</p>

<p>“We couldn’t have a nicer day for this trip,” said
Darry, and all agreed with him.</p>

<p>Salvador knew of a beautiful grove on the shore
of the lake, and to this he directed their course.
There was a little stretch of sand, backed up by a
grove of stately palms, and behind this some rocks
and a waterfall.</p>

<p>“Oh, if only I had my camera,” sighed Sam.
He had brought along a photographic outfit but unfortunately
had left it at the hotel. The rocks and
the waterfall looked very inviting, and they took
their dinner in sight of the place but under the palms,
for the sun was hot in spite of the breeze.</p>

<p>After the meal some of the boys stretched out for
a rest. Sam wished to go swimming but at this the
native boatman shook his head.</p>

<p>“No go here,” said Salvador. “Go in water,
maybe git bit by crab. Bad crab here.”</p>

<p>“Crabs?” said Sam. “I haven’t seen any.”</p>

<p>“Me show you,” returned the boatman and led
the way along the sand. Procuring a sharp stick,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
he walked along until he came to a round hole close
to the water’s edge. He thrust the stick into the
hole. Instantly came a scattering of sand and an
ugly looking brown crab came into view, hissing
viciously and with his eyes bulging from their sockets.
Sam sprang back to get out of harm’s way
but the crab leaped into the lake and sank from
sight.</p>

<p>“What an ugly beast!”</p>

<p>“Him more ugly if you stick toe in his hole,”
grinned Salvador. “Maybe him bite toe off.”</p>

<p>“I believe you,” and Sam gave a shudder. “A
nice beach for swimming truly!”</p>

<p>“The land crabs of South America are all more
or less dangerous,” said Professor Strong, who had
watched proceedings from a distance. “Some of
them are poisonous and all will give you a nasty
bite if they get the chance. You must never bathe
unless you feel certain there is nothing around to
harm you.”</p>

<p>It was not until half an hour later that they prepared
to leave the spot. Some clouds had come up
and Salvador said he was afraid they might be in
for a blow before nightfall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>“I wouldn’t mind a little wind, just for the excitement,”
said Frank.</p>

<p>“Yes, but we don’t want too much,” returned the
professor. “They are as liable to have squalls on
Lake Maracaibo as they are on any of our great
lakes at home.”</p>

<p>“Do you think we’ll get a squall?” cried Hockley,
in something of alarm.</p>

<p>“I trust not, Hockley. If it blows too heavily
we’ll have to run in shore somewhere until it is
over.”</p>

<p>They were soon aboard the boat, the mainsail
was hoisted, and away they ran, in the direction of
the town. The wind was so fresh that the spray
flew in all directions so that it was impossible to
find a dry spot. Hockley grumbled at this, but
there seemed no help for it.</p>

<p>“As it is warm it won’t hurt you,” said Professor
Strong. “As soon as we reach the hotel I will see
to it that all have dry clothing.”</p>

<p>An hour later found them out of sight of land
and bowling along as swiftly as ever. The sky was
now growing darker, the sun having gone behind a
heavy bank of clouds. Presently the wind died out
completely, leaving the sail flapping idly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>“We’re getting a calm instead of a storm,” said
Frank. “And just as we were making such good
time, too!”</p>

<p>“It’s the calm before the storm, Newton,” answered
Professor Strong. “We’ll get more wind
than we want in half an hour.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br />

<small>THE SQUALL ON LAKE MARACAIBO</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> Professor Strong said proved to be true.
In less than half an hour they saw the whitecaps
forming on the lake behind them. The wind came
and went in fitful gusts, and then of a sudden came
a blow that was little short of a hurricane.</p>

<p>“We’re going to catch it now!” shouted Mark.
“Just hear how it whistles!”</p>

<p>“Hold fast, all of you!” came from Professor
Strong.</p>

<p>“We are holding fast,” answered Darry, who
was clinging to the stern sheets with might and
main.</p>

<p>The sail had long since been taken in and Salvador
stood at his rudder, doing his best to keep the
craft up to the wind. But this was no easy task
for the wind was veering around rapidly.</p>

<p>“Gracious, it’s down on us for keeps!” shouted
Frank, a moment later. “Look at that!”</p>

<p>He bobbed his head forward and looking the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
boys made out a low wall of white foam moving on
them with incredible swiftness. There was a strange
humming in the air and the sky became blacker than
ever.</p>

<p>In a twinkling the squall was on them in all its
fury, sending the sloop headlong into the foam.
The boys could see nothing and held their breath in
awful suspense. Hockley fairly shivered with terror,
but none of the others noted this, being too busy
caring for their own safety.</p>

<p>As the sloop veered around, the boiling foam
mounted to the forward deck and Sam was caught
as in the breakers of the ocean. He was clinging
to a low guard, unaware that the thing was partly
rotted away. Without warning came a cracking
and before he realized it he was over the side.</p>

<p>Down and down, and still down went poor Sam,
until he felt that he must be going straight to the
bottom of the lake. He was so bewildered that for
several seconds he scarcely knew what to do. He
turned over and over and clutched out wildly, reaching
nothing but the water, which, at this distance
below the surface, was as calm as ever.</p>

<p>At last the youth struck out for the surface. He
wanted to breathe but knew that if he opened his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
mouth and took in the water it might prove fatal to
him. His head began to grow dizzy and a strange
pain shot across his chest. Then he came up, opened
his eyes and gave a gasp.</p>

<p>“I went overboard,” was his thought. “Where
can the sloop be?”</p>

<p>He tried to call out, but his puny effort was
drowned completely by the wind, which whistled as
fiercely as ever. On every side of him the water
boiled and foamed as before and he was thrown
around like a cork, often turning over and going
beneath the surface.</p>

<p>The next few minutes were to the boy little short
of an age. He strained his eyes for some sign of
the sloop but could see absolutely nothing of the
vessel. He was alone on the broad bosom of Lake
Maracaibo!</p>

<p>Alone! It was an awful thought and as it flashed
over his mind he felt his heart sink like a lump of
lead in his bosom. Alone! Would they come
back for him, or would he be left there to drown?</p>

<p>“They ought to come back,” he muttered.
“They <i>must</i> come back! Oh, God spare me!”
And the prayer was repeated over and over again.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
It gave him strength, and he struck out as best he
could, determined to keep afloat as long as possible.</p>

<p>All told the squall did not last over twenty minutes,
but to poor Sam it seemed an age. He made
scant progress through the milklike foam, but this
did not matter, since he knew not in what direction
he was heading.</p>

<p>“I may be going away from the sloop and away
from land too,” he thought dismally. “But I’ve
got to do something,” and he continued to swim.</p>

<p>His strength was nearly gone when he bumped
into something hard. Laying hold of the object he
found it was a spar, which, from its general appearance,
had been in the water for many months. He
clasped the spar tightly and this sustained him without
further aid.</p>

<p>The gusts of wind had been followed by a heavy
downpour of rain and this continued for all of half
an hour. It was still dark and Sam could not make
out in what direction he was drifting. At last, however,
he saw a dim outline of land ahead and did his
best to shove the spar in that direction. His feet
touched bottom, and more dead than alive he
dragged himself out of the lake and flung himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
headlong in some rank grass under a clump of wild
plantains.</p>

<p>When Sam sat up he found the storm going down
and the setting sun trying to break through the
clouds. The rain had ceased and the bosom of the
lake, while still covered with whitecaps, was gradually
resuming its normal condition.</p>

<p>“What an experience!” he murmured, as he
looked out upon the water. “Wonder if the sloop
weathered it or went to the bottom? Oh, if only
all the rest are safe!”</p>

<p>He arose to his feet but found himself so weak
that he was glad enough to rest again. He was on
a bit of an island for behind him was a wide ditch
which separated the patch from the mainland. In
the distance was a hill backed up by a lofty mountain.
Not a human being nor a habitation of any
sort was in sight.</p>

<p>“I’m alone and no mistake,” he mused. “I wonder
how I had best strike out? Let me see, by the
way the sun lies I must be on the eastern shore of
the lake and if that’s so I’m opposite to the strait
where the town is situated. I’m sure I can’t see
how I’m going to get back to Maracaibo.”</p>

<p>Before Sam could make up his mind how to move<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
darkness was upon him—the darkness of the tropics,
which descends without warning. At this he sprang
up in added alarm.</p>

<p>“I can’t remain here all night,” he thought. “At
least I don’t want to. The place may be full of
snakes and those uncanny land crabs. I must get
up on higher ground if nothing else.”</p>

<p>He set out for the hill he had noticed, but before
he had gone a hundred yards, found himself in the
mire surrounding the ditch.</p>

<p>“This won’t do,” he muttered and started to go
back, but only ended by getting in deeper until he
was up to his knees. He was now thoroughly
alarmed and came to a standstill almost in despair.</p>

<p>Had it been light Sam might have seen that not
far away was a firm stretch of ground leading up to
the hill. But he could not see this and so deemed it
best to get back to where he had first landed.</p>

<p>Retracing his steps was not easy and once he fell,
covering his arms and breast with mud. When he
did get back to the wild plantains he was a sight to
behold and it took him some time to regain his wind.</p>

<p>“I’m a prisoner on this bit of marshland—that’s
all there is to it,” he mused, as he flung himself
down near the edge of the lake. “I suppose I’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
got to make the best of it until morning. But how
am I going to pass the night?”</p>

<p>At the risk of stirring up some of the dreaded
crabs, he waded into the lake and washed himself
of the mud. Then he wrung out his jacket and
hung it up to dry. Fortunately it was a hot night,
so there was no danger of catching cold.</p>

<p>The squall had driven away a good many of the
mosquitoes, which infest Lake Maracaibo almost
as numerously as they do Staten Island, but now the
little pests began to return and presently Sam found
himself kept busy by them and also by a species of
gnats which are equally annoying. To save himself
from their bites he tied his wet handkerchief
over his head and neck.</p>

<p>In planning for the trip Mark had mentioned how
handy it would be for each to take along a waterproof
match-safe and Sam had provided himself
with one of these. Satisfied that he would have to
remain where he was for some hours at the least,
he hunted around for some dry grass and plantain
leaves and proceeded to build himself a smudge fire.
This burnt slowly because of the dampness and the
thick smoke soon put the most of the gnats and
mosquitoes to flight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>The fire, dim as it was, gave an air of cheerfulness
to the spot, and Sam felt much better as he
watched it glow up and then droop. He did not
let it go out, but kept piling on the grass, which he
tore up in clods with ease. This grass is of the
wire variety, very strong, and is much used by the
natives in making baskets and various household
articles.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p202.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">“I heard something, what was it?”</p>

<p>It must have been close to midnight when Sam
fell into a doze, being so worn out he could scarcely
hold up his head. He had piled the fire as high as
possible and his only danger was that the smoke
might veer around and choke him to death.</p>

<p>How long he dozed he could not tell exactly,
afterward, nor could he tell what awoke him. But
he opened his eyes with a start and was on his feet
almost before he was aware.</p>

<p>“I heard something,” he told himself. “What
was it?”</p>

<p>He listened but only a faint breeze blowing
through the grass and wild plantains reached his
ears. He strained his eyes, yet only the total darkness
met his gaze.</p>

<p>Much alarmed Sam continued to stand on guard.
He had cut himself the stalk of a young plantain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
with his jack-knife and he held this in his hands, at
the same time keeping as close to the fire as possible,
knowing that all wild beasts dread anything
burning.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br />

<small>PORT OF THE HAIR</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Where</span> is Sam?”</p>

<p>Such was the question which came from Mark,
after the worst of the blow was over.</p>

<p>“Samuel?” queried Professor Strong, quickly.
“Isn’t he at the bow?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“He must have gone overboard!” ejaculated
Darry. “Sam! Sam! where are you?”</p>

<p>“He did go overboard,” panted Hockley, who
had just been clearing his mouth of lake water. “I
saw him go.”</p>

<p>“Then why didn’t you give the alarm?” demanded
the professor indignantly. “How long ago
was this?”</p>

<p>“Only half a minute, sir. I would have spoken
before, but that last wave almost drowned me.”</p>

<p>“Sam! Sam!” called the others in concert, and
listened attentively for an answer. When none came
they looked at each other in increasing alarm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>“Did you see the boy go overboard?” asked the
professor of the native boatman.</p>

<p>Salvador shook his head. “See noddings,” he
said. “I do best to keep boat from turning up,
<i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>“We must turn back for him,” went on Professor
Strong.</p>

<p>“Turn back, <i>señor</i>? Dat is dangerous,” and the
native shook his head.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, but we must go back, nevertheless.
Here, I will help you bring her around. Boys,
watch for him, two to the right and two to the left.
We must find and save him.”</p>

<p>“Yes! yes!” said Frank. “Poor Sam! What
would his mother say if he was drowned!”</p>

<p>The sloop came around with difficulty and for the
moment threatened to swamp herself. As the water
rolled up, Hockley gave a groan of terror.</p>

<p>“Don’t, please don’t!” he whined. “We’ll all
go to the bottom next. Head her for land!”</p>

<p>“Cling fast and you will be safe,” answered Professor
Strong, who was as cool as ever, although
deeply concerned over Sam’s welfare.</p>

<p>“But we’ll go down—I know we will,” pleaded
the lank youth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>“We are bound to save Sam, so shut up,” cried
Mark, getting angry. “Sam may be nothing to you
but he is a good deal to us,” and thereupon Hockley
became silent, although he shivered with fear every
time the sloop made an extra heavy lurch.</p>

<p>In the midst of the wind and rain it was hard to
follow the back course correctly and without knowing
it they passed far to the westward of where Sam
had gone overboard.</p>

<p>“I can’t see a thing,” remarked Mark, after a
painful silence lasting nearly quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>“Nor I,” returned Frank.</p>

<p>“It’s raining too hard to see much,” came from
Darry.</p>

<p>“It is gradually letting up,” said the professor.
“And he must be somewhere in this neighborhood.”</p>

<p>They continued to cruise around until the sun
went down, much to Hockley’s disgust.</p>

<p>“It’s no use,” said the lank youth. “He’s gone
to the bottom and that’s all there is to it.”</p>

<p>“You ought to be ashamed of yourself to speak
so, Jake Hockley!” retorted Mark. “Haven’t you
any heart?”</p>

<p>“Of course I have, Mark Robertson, but I know a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
thing or two. If he was afloat we’d have found him
long ago.”</p>

<p>“We will continue the search if it takes all night,”
came from the professor. “I cannot believe that
poor Winthrop is drowned.”</p>

<p>“Poor Beans” murmured Darry, and the tears
started to his eyes. “Such a good chap as he was!”
And he felt almost like hurling Hockley overboard
because of his heartlessness.</p>

<p>Upon questioning Salvador, the professor learned
that there was a long stretch of marshland not a
great way off and that it was possible that Sam had
found his way in that direction.</p>

<p>“It is a mile, <i>señor</i>. He would have to be a very
good swimmer to reach it,” said the boatman.</p>

<p>“We’ll sail over to it anyway,” answered Professor
Strong. “We must do something.”</p>

<p>The course of the sloop was changed and they
moved slowly for the marshland, beating against
the wind. Darry was at the bow watching eagerly
for any sign of life which might appear.</p>

<p>“I see something in the water, dead ahead,” he
sang out presently and all rushed forward to investigate.
At first they felt sure it must be Sam’s body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
but as they drew closer found it was nothing but a
mass of seaweed with some rubbish on top.</p>

<p>“Too bad!” came from Hockley. “I thought the
search was ended.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad we didn’t find him drowned,” answered
Frank.</p>

<p>They were interrupted by a cry from the professor.
“I see a light ahead, low down as if on the water’s
edge. It looks like a signal.”</p>

<p>“It must be a signal,” said the native boatman.
“No house dare—no people live dare. All wet
ground and mud, <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>As they drew closer to the fire the professor let
out a long and loud cry:</p>

<p>“Winthrop! Sam Winthrop! Is that you?”</p>

<p>No answer came back and once again the boys felt
a keen disappointment. But the course of the sloop
was not changed and soon they were so close to the
fire that they could see around it quite plainly.</p>

<p>“Somebody is there,” ejaculated Mark.</p>

<p>“Yes, and it’s either Sam or his ghost,” added
Frank. “Hullo, Beans!” he yelled, at the top of
his lungs.</p>

<p>The figure at the fire, which had been watching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
landward, with club upraised, turned suddenly and
peered into the darkness of the lake.</p>

<p>“Who calls?”</p>

<p>“Beans, true enough!” came from Mark.</p>

<p>“Are you safe, Winthrop?” asked the professor,
and then the sloop came up, ramming her bow deeply
in the mud of the bank. In another moment the
crowd was surrounding Sam and the boys were
hugging him warmly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m safe,” answered Sam, when he felt able
to speak. “I—I went to sleep and woke up thinking
some wild animal was going to attack me. I’ve
had a pretty hard time of it, I can tell you.”</p>

<p>“We’ve all had a hard time,” grumbled Hockley.
“We’ve been looking for you for hours.”</p>

<p>“When I went overboard I thought I’d be
drowned sure,” went on Sam, and then he related
his story from beginning to end. “I can tell you, I
want no more Lake Maracaibo squalls.”</p>

<p>“Nor do we,” came from Mark. “It was worse
than the one I once experienced on Lake George,—when
our yacht, the Firefly, was dashed on the
rocks and ruined.”</p>

<p>“Let us all be truly thankful for Winthrop’s escape,”
put in the professor. “It was the act of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
all-wise and all-powerful Providence that has spared
him.”</p>

<p>The little party remained around the fire for quite
a while, talking of the storm and drying their clothing.
Then the blaze was kicked into the water and
they boarded the sloop once more.</p>

<p>“Are you quite sure we won’t have any more
squalls?” asked Sam, of the native boatman.</p>

<p>“Storm gone now—no come back to-night,” answered
Salvador.</p>

<p>Once aboard of the sloop the course was straight
for Maracaibo. But the wind had gone down and it
was not until after sunrise that they ran into the
harbor and landed.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you won’t forget Lake Maracaibo
in a hurry,” said Mark to Sam, as they walked to
their hotel.</p>

<p>“You’re right I won’t,” was the reply. “One
such adventure is enough in a lifetime.”</p>

<p>They were just in time for breakfast and never did
a meal taste better for, as Darry expressed it, “they
were all as hungry as Tomcats locked out for the
summer.” An hour was spent at the hotel and then
they hurried away to catch the steamer back to La
Guayra.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>“I’m going to take a nap when I get on board,”
said Mark, and this he did, and the others followed
his example. They slept for several hours and did
not stir until the steamer ran into the harbor of
Puerto Cabello, situated directly north of Valencia,
and thirty miles by railroad from that city.</p>

<p>“Puerto Cabello means the Port of the Hair,” explained
Professor Strong. “The harbor is so safe
that it was said in olden times that a ship could be
anchored here by a single hair. This used to be a
terrible spot for yellow fever, and Sir Francis Drake
died here of the scourge, after capturing and looting
Caracas and other cities in Queen Elizabeth’s
time.”</p>

<p>Puerto Cabello is one of the most important seaports
of Venezuela. Vessels from many countries
stop there, bringing in goods of all sorts and taking
away cargoes of coffee and cocoa in exchange. The
long warehouses of importers and exporters line the
docks and not far away is the railroad running to
Valencia and other points of more or less importance.
The public buildings are numerous and the usual
statues of Bolivar and other public characters are not
lacking. From Puerto Cabello to Valencia there is
a well-built wagon road and this is used constantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
by traders who are too old-fashioned to use the railroad.</p>

<p>“You cannot hire some of the natives to get on a
train,” said the professor, while they were looking
around the town. “They look upon the railroad as
the invention of the Evil One. They are the ones
who have retarded the progress of South America
for centuries.”</p>

<p>At Puerto Cabello the boys witnessed some trading
which was as interesting as it was amusing. An
old native had brought in some pineapples which he
wished to exchange in trade for some clothing. Instead
of lumping the value of his stock in trade, he
valued each pineapple separately and wanted to know
what it would bring in exchange. Thus he gave two
pineapples for a hat, three for a pair of slippers, one
for a flaming red neckerchief, one for a big brass
pin holding a polished bit of glass, and ten for a pair
of trousers. The latter bargain was made with difficulty,
the clothier taking the trousers and laying
them on his counter and the native placing one pineapple
after another alongside until the clothier
nodded his head to show that he was satisfied. Then
the native, having two pineapples left, traded them
for a small bottle of cologne.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<small>A STOP AT TRINIDAD</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Off</span> for the Orinoco at last! Now for some
real fun and excitement Mark, aren’t you glad that
we have left Caracas and La Guayra behind?”</p>

<p>“I am Frank, and I hope the trip up the Orinoco
proves all we anticipate,” answered Mark, as he
threw himself into a steamer chair beside his chum.
“But as for excitement, I don’t think we have any
reason to complain. We’ve kept a-going pretty well
since we arrived.”</p>

<p>“So we have,” put in Darry, who was close at
hand, watching the last speck of land fade from
sight. “But we haven’t had any fun, in the shape of
hunting, and I suppose that’s what Frank means.”</p>

<p>“To be sure—and fishing, too, and camping out.
It’s all well enough to see the cities and towns, but
I want to see more—the great river and the wonderful
mountains and waterfalls, and all that.”</p>

<p>“I want to see the wild horses,” came from Sam.
“They tell me they have any quantity of them down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
on the <i>llanos</i>, and that you can buy a horse for a
dollar or two any time you want him.”</p>

<p>“A wild horse wouldn’t be of much account until
he was broken,” said Mark. “And in trying to break
him you might break your own neck. You can be
sure they are not so easy to tame as our own domestic
horses.”</p>

<p>“I want a shot at a puma or something like that,”
continued Darry. He had had it all planned out for
a long time—how he was going to send the skin
home for a rug to place in the parlor.</p>

<p>They were on a British steamer bound for Port-of-Spain,
on Trinidad Island, which lies off the
north-east coast of Venezuela. From Port-of-Spain
they expected to catch another steamer bound directly
up the Orinoco to Ciudad Bolivar, the head of
navigation for large steamers, especially during the
dry season.</p>

<p>“It’s a great coast,” said Mark, as he gazed back,
where the mountains were now lost in the distance.
“There ought to be splendid chances for mining
there.”</p>

<p>“There are splendid chances,” said the professor,
who overheard the remark. “The mountains are
full of minerals. But at present most of the mining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
is done in the interior. We will visit some of the
camps along the upper Orinoco.”</p>

<p>The run to Port-of-Spain was a hot one, despite
the breezes which blew, and the boys were glad
enough when, one morning, the steamer turned into
the Gulf of Paria, a great land-locked harbor in
which a vessel can anchor anywhere with ease.</p>

<p>“To the westward is the eastern shore of Venezuela,”
said the professor, “and on the east is the
island of Trinidad, which, as you all know, is a very
valuable British possession. Trinidad is known all
over the United States for it gives to us something
which is used on the finest of our streets. Do any of
you know what that is?”</p>

<p>“Asphalt,” replied Frank. “I have heard that
there is a regular lake of it on the island.”</p>

<p>“There is, ninety-nine acres in extent, and the
asphaltum flows over its banks in all directions, making
natural walks which are almost as hard as stone.
At the center of the lake the pitch is boiling hot and
bubbles up with an odor which is far from pleasant.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind seeing the place,” said Hockley.</p>

<p>“We may get a chance to view it from a distance.
To get too close would not be pleasant. The job of
getting the asphaltum out is one of the meanest on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
earth. The stuff is chopped off the surface in spots
where it is cold, and no matter how deep a hollow is
made, nature soon fills it again. How the Pitch
Lake, as it is termed, originated, has bothered scientists
since its discovery.”</p>

<p>“Do you notice the difference in the appearance
of the water,” remarked Sam. “It was blue before,
now it is a dirty brown. Has that anything to do
with that Pitch Lake?”</p>

<p>“No, Winthrop, the dirt you see is washed into
the Gulf from the Orinoco, which has a number of
mouths in this vicinity, as well as mouths emptying
directly into the Atlantic.”</p>

<p>Before nightfall they came in sight of the port and
dropped anchor in the roadstead, for the harbor of
Port-of-Spain is too shallow to admit the passage
of large vessels. Soon a small craft came alongside
and took them ashore.</p>

<p>“We are in an English country sure enough,” declared
Mark. “See how many English there are.
It does one good to hear the language spoken again.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed in the town,”
said Professor Strong. “It looks so beautiful from
a distance. It is very dirty, and many of the houses
are little better than huts. Of course the English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
that are here live well enough. It is the native element
that is away behind the times.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the party managed to find a comfortable
hotel, kept by a whole-souled son of Great
Britain, who rejoiced in the name of Wellington
Cunningham.</p>

<p>“Glad to know you,” said Wellington Cunningham.
“Make yourselves at ’ome. So you are bound
for the upper Orinoco, eh? Take my hadvice and
stay away from the bloody country. Hi know hall
habout it, Hi do. Went there in ’87 and halmost died
of the bloody fever. Hit ain’t fit for a white man.
If the fever gets you you’re a corpse.”</p>

<p>“That’s cheerful,” was Mark’s comment. “But
we are not going to stay very long.”</p>

<p>“Better not go. Hif you want to see the world
visit Hold Hingland. No better country on the
globe.”</p>

<p>“No better?” queried Frank, with a wink at his
chums. “What of the United States?”</p>

<p>“Too green, lad, too green. ’Twill be hall right
henough when you ’ave the age,” responded Wellington
Cunningham, solemnly.</p>

<p>“It suits us—we wouldn’t want anything better,”
said Mark, dryly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>The hotel was crowded with people, and among
the number was a Colorado gold miner named Andrew
Hume, who was bound for the upper Orinoco
on a prospecting expedition. The miner was both
good-hearted and talkative and was soon on first-class
terms with our friends.</p>

<p>“That Englishman makes me snicker,” said Andy
Hume, as he wished himself to be called. “He talks
about the States, and what he don’t know would fill
the Colorady river basin. Asked me if the Injuns
interfered with the mining, and if the miners and
other folks out west wasn’t afraid the bears and
buffaloes would eat ’em up! When I told him I
hadn’t seen a bear nor a buffalo for years, and told
him the only Injuns in our camp was three good-fer-nuthin
scamps who laid around the saloons all
day soaking firewater, he looked at me as if I was
crazy. He must think Colorady and Californy are
howling wildernesses.”</p>

<p>“No doubt he does think that,” said Mark. “But
then, you must remember, we have some queer notions
of South America and South Africa. I didn’t
dream that everything in Venezuela—I mean in the
cities—was so up-to-date,—telephones, electric lights,
street cars, and all that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>“Well, I’m with you there, lad, I didn’t dream
of ’em myself. And I heard of something yesterday
that kind of stumped me, too. They have mines and
mining machinery away up back in the country just
as good as any in Colorady or Californy. Some
syndicates running ’em and making millions out of
’em, too, I reckon.”</p>

<p>It was found that Hume intended to take a steamer
for Ciudad Bolivar on the following Monday, and
the professor succeeded, after some difficulty, in procuring
passage for his party on the same vessel.
This pleased the old miner, and he said he trusted
they would have a good trip and become firm friends.</p>

<p>Although the town of Port-of-Spain is far from
beautiful, the country back of the city is all that one’s
heart could desire. There are fine highways running
in all directions, lined with the most beautiful of
tropical trees and shrubbery. Flowers grow in
Trinidad in endless profusion and birds and butterflies
are equally numerous, not to mention the monkeys
and parrots.</p>

<p>“It’s a Paradise in spots,” observed Darry. “But
only in spots. I don’t think I would care to live here.”</p>

<p>On Sunday they visited the cathedral of the city,
and here heard not only an excellent sermon but likewise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
some fine music. In the afternoon they visited
the botanical gardens, the pride of all Englishmen
residing in Trinidad. The collection of flowers, ferns
and trees were certainly remarkable and one not
easily forgotten.</p>

<p>The boys were up bright and early Monday morning,
and by nine o’clock were on the steamer, bag
and baggage. At Port-of-Spain the professor had
visited a number of establishments and procured such
additions to their outfit as he deemed necessary.</p>

<p>“We will have to go well equipped,” he said.
“For I know but little of the towns in the interior.
At the time I visited here before they amounted to
but little, so far as being able to buy what one wished
was concerned. They kept plenty of goods for the
native trade, but those things wouldn’t suit you.”</p>

<p>“No, I’d rather stick to what I’m used to,” said
Sam. “It’s enough to go into a strange country
among a strange people, without putting up with
things to wear and use with which you are unacquainted.”</p>

<p>At Port-of-Spain the boys all received letters from
home and sent long communications in return. They
related all their various adventures but touched
lightly upon the perils encountered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>“It’s no use of scaring the folks to death,” was
the way in which Mark put it. “What’s past is
past, and let that end it.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” said Darry. “Besides, if we said
too much our folks might write to us to come home
on the next steamer.”</p>

<p>The only one of the party who was at all downcast
was Hockley. This youth had hoped to meet
Dan Markel and get back at least some of his property.
Now he felt that the chance of doing this was
slipping away forever.</p>

<p>“By the time we get back to the coast he’ll be gone
for good—and nobody will know where,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well, why don’t you go back to Caracas and
hunt for him,” returned Frank. “We’re not compelling
you to go along.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t blow about it,” cried Hockley, angrily.
“I’ll do what I please, without advice from
you.”</p>

<p>“The man may turn up yet,” put in Mark. “I
don’t think he’d come to Venezuela without he had
some object in so doing.”</p>

<p>“I heard him say something about a gold mine
once,” said Sam. “Perhaps he thought to try his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
luck in that direction—after he found he had to
settle down.”</p>

<p>“His gold mine is out of somebody else’s pocket,”
grumbled Hockley, and walked away, amid a laugh
which could not be repressed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<small>UP THE RIVER TO BOLIVAR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are several ways of entering the Orinoco
proper, but the main stream is the Boca de Navios,
flowing eastward into the Atlantic. This great body
of water is cut into two channels, each about two
miles wide, by a series of islands, some little more
than marshlands and others hilly and covered with
heavy tropical growths.</p>

<p>“The exact length of the Orinoco is not known,”
said the professor, in reply to a question from Mark.
“It would be a difficult matter to reach its source,
which is located somewhere in the Sierra Parime
Mountains, thousands of feet up among the clouds.
Roughly speaking the stream proper is almost two
thousand miles long.”</p>

<p>“But we can’t sail that far, can we?” asked
Hockley.</p>

<p>“By no means. Bolivar, for which we are now
bound, marks the head of tide water, and there we
will have to take a smaller vessel, even though the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
river at that point is several miles wide and over
three hundred feet deep. Bolivar is about two hundred
and fifty miles from the ocean, and about half
way to where the Orinoco is joined by the Apure
River, in the west. From this point the Orinoco
branches southward, through a country of <i>llanos</i>
and immense forests, until it approaches the Sierra
Parime Mountains, where it is much broken by cascades
and rocky canyons. At this point there is a
small stream, the Casiquiare, which connects with
the Rio Negro, a large river flowing into the Amazon
of Brazil.”</p>

<p>“Are there many towns on the river?” questioned
Frank.</p>

<p>“Towns, yes, but no cities worth mentioning.
Along the upper Orinoco the inhabitants are mostly
natives who raise stock and gather cocoa beans,
tonqua beans—used for soaps and perfumes—and
fruits. To the southward, are immense forests
where rubber is found, and in the mountains are the
valuable mines which we have already mentioned.
Some of these mines are held to be worth ten to
twenty millions of dollars each.”</p>

<p>“Gracious! I wouldn’t mind owning one of
those myself,” said Darry, in a low voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>“In years gone by the Spaniards worked these
mines and drew from them a wealth that amazed the
whole of Europe. But through revolutions and
earthquakes many of the mines were abandoned and
forgotten, and to this day some which are known to
have been exceedingly valuable cannot be located.”</p>

<p>“I say, let us try to locate one of them!” cried
Frank, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you’ll have much luck,” responded
the professor, dryly. “Many of the best of miners
have tried and failed.”</p>

<p>Mark turned to Andy Hume, who sat close by,
smoking a short briar-root pipe.</p>

<p>“Is that your game, Mr. Hume?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Andy Hume, please,” returned the old miner.
“Never could get used to a handle to my name nohow.”
He blew a cloud of smoke into the air.
“Wall, about that being my game, it is and it isn’t.
I’m going prospecting, and I don’t care if I strike
something new or something old so long as it pans
out good. I’ve heard tell of those old Spanish mines
and of all the bloodshed it cost to get the gold out
of ’em and out of the country. In those days a man
wasn’t safe if he had over a hundred dollars’ worth
of dust on his person. And even when he got out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
of the country he wasn’t certain but what some
pirate would capture the ship he was sailing on and
make him walk the plank to Davy Jones’ locker.”</p>

<p>“I wish we were going with you,” said Darry,
impulsively.</p>

<p>“Thank you, lad, but the life wouldn’t suit you
nohow. It’s not easy. Prospecting is dangerous
work, and I’ve seen the time when I got lost in the
mountains and didn’t have a bite to eat for forty-eight
hours. That’s an experience that’s enough to
drive one crazy.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it is. But if you strike it rich—”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, if you do strike it. But you don’t more
often than you do.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever strike luck in our own country?”
asked Hockley, who was as interested as anybody
in the conversation.</p>

<p>“Yes, twice. Once I was in the Cripple Creek
district and found a nugget worth two thousand
dollars. Another time I was up on Lone Man’s
Ledge and located the Daisy Mine with a fellow
named Bargess. The Daisy proved to be a splendid
payer and we took out ten thousand dollars’ worth
of dust in less than two weeks. Both Bargess and
me were delighted I can tell you. I went down to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
town to prove up the claim and while I was gone
what did Bargess do but gather all the gold in sight
and run away to Mexico with it.”</p>

<p>“But he had to leave the mine,” said Darry.</p>

<p>“He did, but it never paid as well as it had at the
start, and I stopped working it six weeks later. I
wish I could find Bargess.”</p>

<p>“You never heard of him afterward?”</p>

<p>“Never a word, excepting that somebody had
once seen him in Mexico at a town called La Dardado.
If I should run across him I think there
would be some warm work the next few minutes,”
added the old miner, pointedly.</p>

<p>The accommodations on the steamer, while not
elegant, were yet sufficient for comfort, and the
days passed swiftly enough to the boys. Mark and
Darry were studying Spanish, for they felt that a
knowledge of the language would be of great use to
them. Frank and Sam also studied a little. Hockley
was too lazy to occupy himself in any manner.
Seeking a shady corner of the deck he would stretch
out at full length and sleep from one hour’s end to
the next.</p>

<p>“He certainly believes in taking it easy,” said
Sam to Darry, as they happened to pass the youth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
“Of one thing you can be sure, he’ll never kill himself
by overwork.”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose he’ll have to, if his father is as
rich as he pretends. But the heat has got something
to do with his laziness. It’s terrific.”</p>

<p>“Well, we can’t expect anything different for we
are within seven or eight degrees of the equator.
If it wasn’t for the nights I don’t see how any of us
could stand it.”</p>

<p>Although the river was wide, the steamer moved
along the channel slowly and with caution. This
was done because of the numerous bars and snags
which form to impede navigation—just as they
sometimes form on the Mississippi and Missouri of
our own country.</p>

<p>“It is said that once this river country was populated
by great tribes of Indians that have to-day
totally disappeared,” said the professor. “They
were a peaceful nation, living on the fruit which
abounded on every side, on the numerous fish which
the river afforded, and on the small wild animals
found in the forests. But soon after Columbus discovered
the land, the Spaniards came over with a
thirst for gold and power, and that was the end of a
peace which had perhaps reigned for centuries.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>“What of a pre-historic civilization here?”
asked Sam.</p>

<p>“Some few traces have been found, but not many.
The civilization was confined more directly to the
western coast of the country and to Central America.
But even of that the most is lost, and lost perhaps
forever.”</p>

<p>The outlook along the lower Orinoco is not inviting,
and the boys soon tired of it. Either bank
was lined with grass and reeds, with here and there
a patch of wild brushwood, the home of birds innumerable.
Pelicans were there, and wild ducks,
and there was an odor of heated salt-meadow water
which was at times almost overpowering. In the
distance were immense forests, but so far off that
nothing about them could be clearly distinguished.</p>

<p>“Set a fellow ashore along there and he could get
lost without half trying,” observed Mark. “How
awfully lonesome it looks.”</p>

<p>“Spare me from getting lost!” said Frank, with
something like a shiver. “I just want to have a
good time and nothing else.”</p>

<p>To help pass the time, the professor brought out
one of the guns and some ammunition and let them
take turns at shooting the wild birds as they came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
within reasonable distance, at the same time giving
the lads several necessary lessons in aiming.</p>

<p>“Don’t be in a hurry,” he cautioned to Frank.
“Be quick, but not too quick, is a good huntsman’s
motto. Now try your hand at the pelican yonder.”</p>

<p>Frank took careful aim and fired, but missed his
mark. Then Darry tried and the big water bird
was hit in the wing, and speedily dove out of sight
among the reeds.</p>

<p>“Please let me try at something else,” pleaded
Frank, and when another bird came in range the
professor did so. The youth was now more careful
and the bird came down like a stone. But it fell
into the river and could not be secured.</p>

<p>The shooting lasted all of an hour and at the conclusion
Professor Strong declared himself well satisfied
with results. “No one is such a terribly bad
shot,” he said. “And a little practice will do wonders,
as you will soon learn.”</p>

<p>When the town of Bolivar was reached the boys
were surprised to find it located on a bluff, sixty or
seventy feet above the river level. It is a very
ancient place and boasts of a fortress built by the
Spaniards ages ago.</p>

<p>“The town is built so high up on account of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
swelling of the stream during the wet season,” said
Professor Strong. “When the rains are extra severe
the river rises fifty and even sixty feet and
often carries away large sections of plantations
along its bank.”</p>

<p>“There seems to be plenty of shipping,” observed
Mark. “There are ships here of a dozen nationalities.”</p>

<p>“Bolivar is the custom-house port for the whole
of the Orinoco, which accounts for all those ships
being here. The territory to be covered being so
vast, an immense amount of business is done,
amounting to millions of dollars annually. Gold is
exported in large quantities. There are a dozen factories
where cigars and stogies are made.”</p>

<p>They were soon ashore and climbing the hilly
street to one of the hotels. It was a busy scene, and
quite like New York, so Mark declared, on account
of the various nationalities to be seen,—American
and English miners, German shipping merchants,
French and Italian shop and hotel keepers, and negro
and other native workmen, all intermingling in the
most friendly manner.</p>

<p>“Everybody seems to be smoking,” said Darry.
“Negroes, priests, women and all. I never dreamed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
of such a sight. And some of those workmen
haven’t clothing enough to be decent,” he added, in
some disgust.</p>

<p>By inquiries at a shipping office it was learned
that no steamer for up the river could be had until
two days later. This would give them a chance to
inspect the city buildings, the parks, and other points
of interest.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br />

<small>SOMETHING ABOUT COCOA AND CHOCOLATE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Before</span> we go any further up the river I wish
you boys to visit a cocoa plantation and learn something
about cocoa and chocolate,” said the professor
on the following morning. “There is a large plantation
not many miles from here, and we will take a
drive to it in a carriage immediately after breakfast.”</p>

<p>At this announcement all were pleased but Hockley,
who drew down the corners of his mouth in disapproval.</p>

<p>“It will be dead slow,” he muttered. “I’d rather
see the sights in the town.”</p>

<p>“We will view those later,” replied the professor.
He had no intention of leaving the tall youth behind
again, and Hockley realized it and made no further
remonstrance.</p>

<p>The plantation was a large affair, situated upon
a small creek flowing into the Orinoco. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
owned by a German merchant doing business in
Bolivar, and it was the merchant himself who
showed them around the place.</p>

<p>“As you can see,” said Professor Strong, when
they were walking around, “the cocoa is set out
very much as is coffee. The seeds are planted in a
seed-bed and kept there two or three months. Then
the shoots are planted in the field, between shade
trees, with ditches cut through the field for irrigating
purposes. The trees begin to bear in about
five years and with care will last for thirty-five to
forty years.”</p>

<p>“But where does the chocolate come in?” interrupted
Hockley.</p>

<p>“Chocolate is made from the seed of the cocoa
pod, so called. This pod, as you can see, is about
the shape of a cantelope, and when ripe, is reddish
in color. Each pod contains fifty or seventy-five
seeds, each the size of one’s thumb nail. The trees
give two crops a year, one in June and the other in
December.”</p>

<p>“Do they use the beans as they are?” came from
Sam.</p>

<p>“No. After the pods are gathered they are
placed in the sun to dry. As soon as they burst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
open the beans are shelled out and sorted. Some
growers then bag them and sell them in that shape,
but others declare that the best cocoa is produced by
placing the beans in the ground until they are about
half rotted. Cocoa, such as we drink at home, is
made by breaking the beans up, or shaving them fine,
and then boiling in water or milk, and serving with
sugar. Chocolate is made by mixing the crushed up
beans with sugar and with some spices, to give it a
special flavor. Of course you all know cake chocolate
and chocolate bonbons. Cake chocolate unsweetened
is generally cocoa beans ground up and
mixed with flour or other foreign substances to give
it weight. Sweet chocolate cakes have sugar, honey
and very often some spices in them. Bonbons are
made of cocoa, sugar, flavoring extracts and anything
else the wide-awake confectioner chooses to
put into them to strike the palate of his customer.
Cocoa and chocolate, if pure, are very nourishing,
and have none of the bad effects on the system that
are attributed to coffee.”</p>

<p>“What is cacao?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“That is only another name for cocoa, Newton.
Cocoa often grows in a wild state, but the beans are
not as large as when cultivated. In some districts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
where money is scarce, cocoa beans are used instead
in buying and selling. A native will gather all the
beans he can in a little bag and then come into town
and barter them for whatever he wants—and there
was a time when he could pay his taxes in beans.”</p>

<p>“Well, that isn’t so very strange,” put in Darry.
“In revolutionary times in our own country, they
used to pay taxes and other demands in corn and
grain.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and they pay taxes now, in country places,
by working on the public highways,” added Frank.</p>

<p>The walk around the cocoa plantation proved full
of interest, and when it was concluded and they had
taken some of the bitter-sweet beans from a tree as
souvenirs the proprietor of the place invited them
to lunch in his summer-house, an affair built in true
German style under the wide spreading branches of
a royal palm.</p>

<p>“In my <i>gartenlaube</i> you shall drink chocolate that
is chocolate,” said their host. “Not the chocolate
you often get at home, adulterated with pipe-clay or
something like that, but that which is made from
the pure bean mixed with the cleanest of sugar.”</p>

<p>He was as good as his word, and with the creamy
chocolate came German coffee-cake equally good.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
All of the boys drank the chocolate eagerly, and
Frank could not help but smack his lips over it.</p>

<p>“I never tasted anything better,” he declared.
“If I could get it as good at home I’d never touch
coffee again,” and Mark said the same.</p>

<p>Their host was a talkative man, and wished to
know all about their proposed trip up the river.</p>

<p>“You will see many interesting sights,” he said.
“I have been up twice—four years ago and two
years ago. The last time I went up the natives were
having a bitter quarrel among themselves and I had
all I could do to keep out of trouble. But generally
they are very friendly and will do anything for you
if you pay them fair wages.”</p>

<p>On returning to the city they met Andy Hume,
who had been interviewing a number of miners who
had just come in from one of the mining districts.</p>

<p>“They’ve struck two new mines,” he said, “and
both good payers. I pumped ’em pretty thoroughly
and I think I can strike something good if I go right
at it. I wish the boat sailed to-day instead of to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to be patient,” said Professor
Strong, with a smile. “I fancy you will find plenty
of unexplored territory when you get there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>With so many things to look at the time slipped by
quickly. An hour was spent the next day at one
of the cigar factories, where the boys watched the
workmen roll cigars and pack them in boxes. But
the smell was so strong that Frank and Sam came
away more than half sick.</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine how they can stand it to work
in such a place,” said Frank. “It’s enough to
sicken a dog.”</p>

<p>“It is what they get used to,” said Mark. “But
I must say I didn’t like it myself.”</p>

<p>At last came the time to bid adieu to Bolivar,
which in former days was called Angostura. They
went aboard the little paddle-box steamer loaded
with bundles, for they had left their trunks at the
hotel, to remain there until their return.</p>

<p>“I suppose that’s the last of civilization,” remarked
Frank. “Now for the forests and a good
time hunting, fishing, and camping out.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t be quite so fast,” said the professor,
with a laugh. “It will be at least a week
before we reach any place for hunting and fishing.
Of course we could stop off on the way, but I take it
you boys wish to get right into the mountains.”</p>

<p>“So we do,” came from several of the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>“This boat will make a number of stops first—at
Muitogo, at Altagracia, at Caicara, where the
river Apure joins the Orinoco, and at points of lesser
importance, until we reach the Meta River, which
runs into Colombia. At that point we will disembark
and hire a native boat to take us up into the
mountains as far as we care to go, past the Falls of
Atures and into a region which is even to-day but
little known to the outside world.”</p>

<p>“And how many miles shall we sail to get to the
mountains?” asked Darry.</p>

<p>“About six hundred from here.”</p>

<p>“And after that how far shall we go?” questioned
Hockley.</p>

<p>“As far as we please. You all wish to see what
a tropical jungle is like, and wish to hunt and fish,
and I am going to do my best to accommodate you.
If all goes well, we will have some excellent sport
between now and the time we return,” concluded
Professor Strong.</p>

<p>To the boys, impatient to get into the forests, the
time on the side-wheeler went but slowly. Day
after day was spent on deck, gazing at the vast plains
on one side of the river and the forest on the other.
They made the stops mentioned, and also several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
others, but none of the party went ashore, for the
heat was terrific.</p>

<p>“We can’t get out of this too quick for me,” said
Hockley. “I feel about half fried out already.”</p>

<p>“The climate changes as one nears the mountains,”
returned the professor. “You won’t suffer
so much in a few days,” and his words proved true.
As they came in sight of the first of the mountains—really
the foothills of the Andes—the thermometer
dropped half a dozen degrees and the nights proved
all that could be desired.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI<br />

<small>CAMPING ON THE UPPER ORINOCO</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">What</span> a truly grand sight!”</p>

<p>It was Mark who uttered the words. He stood
in the bow of a long canoe, manned by a single Indian,
who was sending the craft along the bosom of
the silent river with skill and swiftness.</p>

<p>On each side of the canoe the dark waters of the
upper Orinoco stretched to a distance of a hundred
yards or more. Beyond were gigantic forests of
mahogany, rose-wood, grenadilla, ebony, and rubber
trees. Beneath the trees were immense ferns and
strange varicolored mosses, and over and through
all grew the ever-present tropical vines, forming
meshes which were well-nigh impassable.</p>

<p>The sun shone far to the westward, but the river
lay in a deep shadow, and the many birds which had
sung so gaily during the day had ceased their song,
giving place to the sounds of the oncoming night.
Far in the distance some wild parrots screeched out
boldly, and many monkeys added a chorus of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
own. As Mark gazed at a tree which stood at the
bend of the stream he saw something uncurl itself
and drop into the water with a slight splash.</p>

<p>“What was that?” he asked of the professor,
who was nearest to him.</p>

<p>“That was a water snake, Robertson. An ugly
creature, too, if you meet him in his native element.”</p>

<p>“Ugh, a snake! Then I guess we won’t land
there.”</p>

<p>“The Indian says he knows of a nice spot a mile
beyond here, where there is a cleared place on the
brow of a little bluff. To camp in the midst of such
a jungle as this would be very unwise.”</p>

<p>For three days the party had been traveling along
the upper Orinoco in the canoe, which was a stout
affair, over twenty feet long and with a little hood
in the stern for protection from the sun. The last
village at which they had stopped had been left ten
miles behind and here they had bidden adieu to
Andy Hume, who was in another boat and who
wished to explore one of the many tributaries of the
Orinoco which join the mighty stream at this point.</p>

<p>The trip in the canoe had been full of interest.
They passed several rapids, and at one point had
had to “tote” the canoe and its contents around a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
picturesque waterfall. They had gone fishing under
the directions of the Indian, whose name was Cubara,
and had brought in a fine mess, which had been
cooked over the camp-fire in true hunter fashion.
They had even gone hunting and each of the boys
had brought down several tropical birds of gorgeous
plumage. They had wanted to go swimming, but
this the professor had not allowed, fearing there
might be something in the water to harm them.</p>

<p>The Indian was a knowing fellow and bright, although
not given to much talking. He had been
selected by the professor because of his knowledge
of English, which was, however, slight. He took
particularly to Frank, who had given him a pocket
looking-glass he chanced to have with him.</p>

<p>“Well I wish we were landed,” grumbled Hockley,
who sat under the hood of the canoe, taking it
easy. “I am tired of this everlasting water. There
is a sameness that is perfectly sickening.”</p>

<p>“That’s because you don’t enjoy the beauties of
nature,” returned Darry, with a grin. “You haven’t
the poetic temperament, so to speak.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t poke fun at me,” growled the lank
youth, with a scowl. “I say there is sameness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
and there is. It’s been nothing but water and trees
ever since we started.”</p>

<p>“If I were you, Hockley, I’d get out and wade
back,” put in Frank. “I can’t imagine what made
you come.”</p>

<p>“I came to have a good time, but it’s no good
time drifting in a canoe like this,” was the surly response.
“If we were ashore—”</p>

<p>“We’ll soon be ashore,” interrupted Mark.
“There is the bluff, just around the bend. Cubara
is right, it’s an ideal spot for camping out.”</p>

<p>“If there isn’t a puma there waiting to chew us
up,” added Frank, but the smile on his face showed
that he was not particularly afraid.</p>

<p>The canoe was run in among the bushes lining
the bank below the bluff, and leaping ashore the Indian
pulled the craft well out of the water. Then
one after another leaped to the dry ground beyond.</p>

<p>“Leave the baggage where it is for the present,”
said the professor. “I want to take a look around
before I decide to pitch camp. There may be some
objection which Cubara has overlooked.”</p>

<p>But there was none, and soon they had everything
ashore and up to the edge of the bluff, which arose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
from the surrounding jungle to a height of thirty
feet. To one side of the bluff was a series of rough
rocks leading down to the river and on the other was
a beautiful waterfall coming from a mountain a mile
or more to the eastward. On the other side of the
Orinoco the virgin forests stretched for miles.</p>

<p>As in all tropical localities night came on swiftly,
and by the time they had brought all their things to
the top of the bluff and started a camp-fire darkness
was upon them, lit up only by a few bright stars far
overhead. They had brought with them a fair sized
tent and Sam and Darry were soon hard at work
cutting the necessary poles for erecting the shelter.</p>

<p>“These forests look as if they had never seen the
axe of a woodsman,” said Sam. “What immense
trees! Some of them must be two hundred feet
high.”</p>

<p>The poles were soon cut and then the erection of
the tent began. It was placed at a point where the
ground sloped a little, which would allow the water
to run off in case it rained. It was fastened down
with extra heavy stakes so that nothing short of a
hurricane would be able to level it.</p>

<p>The tent erected, they took the most valuable of
their stores inside, piling them up at the rear. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
was a case for their guns, another containing ammunition,
and a third medicines, and also several bundles
of clothing. They had also brought with them
a number of canned goods, coffee, sugar, salt and
some jerked beef, in case they should be unable to
bring down their own meat. The jerked beef had
been purchased at Apure, where there is a large
market for beef, both “on the hoof” and prepared.
Among the stores were also a bag of flour and a
small bag of beans—the latter brought along by
Sam, who declared that he was going to have his
usual Sunday morning delicacy, no matter what happened.</p>

<p>It was decided by the professor that throughout
their stay in the jungle each should take his turn at
watching during the night. “There are seven of us
all told,” he said. “And that will give each only
about an hour apiece, which will be no hardship.
Perhaps nothing will come to disturb us, but with
one on guard all the others will be able to sleep in
comfort.”</p>

<p>The first night in the camp passed without anything
unusual occurring. The boys were up bright
and early, and Mark discovered a pool at the foot
of the waterfall where they might bathe and wash<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
to their hearts’ content. The water was as cool as
it was pure and refreshed them wonderfully.</p>

<p>“Makes a fellow feel like living again,” cried
Darry, as he splashed around. “I presume that
water comes from the very top of yonder mountain.”</p>

<p>“No doubt of it,” returned Mark, “and some of
it may be melted snow for all we know.”</p>

<p>Hockley had been too lazy to take a bath, and still
lay on the flooring of the tent, snoring lustily. To
wake him up, Darry went and pulled him by the
foot.</p>

<p>“Hi, you, let go!” cried the sleepy youth, as he
sat up. “Can’t you let me sleep?”</p>

<p>“Time for breakfast,” returned Darry. “We’ve
had a bath.”</p>

<p>“Have you? Well, I’m not so dirty as all that.
After this you let me sleep as long as I please.”</p>

<p>“All right,” returned Darry, coolly. And as he
turned away he added, in an undertone to Frank:
“What a perfect bear he is! I wish he had remained
at home.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” was the answer. “But as he is with
us we’ll have to make the best of it.”</p>

<p>While the others were getting breakfast Hockley
began leisurely to dress himself. He had pulled on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
one shoe and was holding the other when of a sudden
he gave a cry of terror and leaped up wildly.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p248.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">“Take it off! Take it off!”</p>

<p>“Take it off! Take it off!”</p>

<p>“What is it?” demanded the professor, quickly,
and rushed to his side.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what it is. It crawled out of my
shoe. Take it off!”</p>

<p>He pointed to a creature four or five inches long,
with many legs and with horned jaws, which rested
on his knee, shaking its tiny head from one side to
the other.</p>

<p>“A centipede!” murmured Professor Strong, and
doubling up his finger he snapped the thing to the
ground and there quickly stamped on it.</p>

<p>“A centipede!” bawled Hockley. “They’re
poisonous, so I’ve heard. I—I think he bit me in
the back of the hand. Do you think that if he did
it will prove fa-fatal?” And he turned pale.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so, Hockley. Let me see your
hand.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. But hadn’t we better get out of here?
There may be more around?”</p>

<p>“We might go where there are more instead of
less. Venezuela is full of centipedes, and some of
them are dangerous. But that wasn’t such a big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
fellow, and your hand seems to be all right. They
won’t bite a human being unless they are pushed to
it, and some natives do not mind the bites at all.”</p>

<p>“No hurt me,” put in Cubara, with a smile.
“Some of my people eat dem—no poison much,
no,” and he shook his head vigorously.</p>

<p>“I don’t want any more of them,” growled Hockley.
“What a nasty looking thing—with so many
legs!”</p>

<p>“You always want to shake out everything you
wear before you put it on,” said the professor, to all
of the boys. “If you don’t you may encounter
scorpions and tarantulas as well as centipedes. They
are the great drawbacks to almost every hot country.”</p>

<small>BRINGING DOWN AN OCELOT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> centipede scare had been almost too much
for Hockley, and he hardly ate a mouthful of the
breakfast which the others prepared.</p>

<p>“It’s a nasty country—I’m sorry I came here,”
he told Mark. “I expected a better time.”</p>

<p>“Well you are here and that’s the end of it,” was
the simple answer. “But perhaps things won’t be
so bad after we get used to it.”</p>

<p>“I thought it would be like hunting in the mountains
of Pennsylvania. I once went out there and
had a fine time, bringing down small game and fishing
for trout. But that awfully big jungle—”
Hockley did not finish, but his look of fear was more
impressive than words.</p>

<p>However, the breakfast passed off pleasantly
enough and inside of an hour all the boys were at
the river bank, baiting their hooks under the direction
of Cubara, who told them that he had once
made his living as a fisherman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>“I catch de fish in de mountains,” he said. “Sell
dem to de gold miners. Da no take time to fish, so
pay big price.”</p>

<p>“I suppose the miners don’t care to do anything
but hunt for gold,” remarked Frank.</p>

<p>“Hunt, hunt, hunt, night an’ day,” was the answer.
“Some go ’way up de big mountains, stay
dare many, many moons, come back, no gold, all
crazy.”</p>

<p>“Crazy!”</p>

<p>“Yes, crazy, stay alone so long, no want dat to
fish for him. He crazy, maybe he kill!” And Cubara
shrugged his bony shoulders.</p>

<p>“That’s a cheerful outlook for Andy Hume,”
murmured Mark. “I sincerely hope he doesn’t go
crazy through loneliness.”</p>

<p>“I have heard of such cases in our own country,”
put in the professor. “Some miners went crazy
during the gold fever in California, and only a few
months ago I was reading in the newspapers of a
prospector in Alaska who had gone insane through
having lost himself in the mountains. It is no
child’s play—this trying to make nature yield up
her secrets.”</p>

<p>Fishing lasted all of the morning, and by noon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
they had twenty-odd specimens of the finny tribe in
a pool of fresh water among the rocks. Most of the
catch were of the perch variety, although somewhat
different from the class usually found in our own
streams.</p>

<p>“Haven’t run across any of those wonderful electric
eels,” said Hockley. “I thought we’d be sure
to be shocked to death,” he added, with a sniff.</p>

<p>“Electric eels not here,” said Cubara. “Take
you to dem udder day maybe.”</p>

<p>“I want to go hunting first,” put in Sam. He
was longing to shoot something big.</p>

<p>“We’ll go hunting this afternoon,” said the professor.</p>

<p>“I don’t care to go hunting,” said Hockley. “I’d
rather take it easy to-day.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then, you may remain in camp with
Cubara, Hockley.”</p>

<p>The dinner was rather a hasty one, and a short
while later Professor Strong and four of the boys
set out. Each was armed with a rifle or shotgun,
and each carried some food for supper, should they
not return until late.</p>

<p>The professor had had a long talk with the Indian
regarding the game in the vicinity, and Cubara had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
told him where they were likely to find a number of
peccaries, a wild animal common to many parts of
Venezuela and one much sought after by the natives
for food. The peccary is not unlike a wild hog in
general appearance, and when full grown weighs
from fifty to sixty pounds. They are very fierce
when attacked and have short tusks which are as
sharp as daggers.</p>

<p>The way was up the mountain side behind the
camp, over tall rocks and around spots where the
undergrowth was absolutely impenetrable. Overhead
the sun shone down from a cloudless sky, yet
under the gigantic trees not a ray was to be found,
so thick was the foliage.</p>

<p>As they advanced the constant screeching of
green parrots reached their ears, mingled with the
distant pandemonium created by a tribe of howling
monkeys.</p>

<p>“What a noise they make,” cried Darry. “I
never heard such a racket in my life.”</p>

<p>“Those monkeys are the genuine ring-tail howling
monkeys,” laughed the professor. “They are
the pest of a hunter’s camp. When once they make
up their mind to serenade you at night nothing short
of a hurricane can stop them. Their howl, heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
in the darkness, is the most mournful sound on earth,
ten times worse than that of a dog baying at the
moon.”</p>

<p>“Are they dangerous?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>“Not generally speaking, although you want to
be careful of what you do to them. A shot from a
gun will sometimes scatter them for an hour or so.
But if you pick up a stone and hurl it at them, they
will surely pick up other stones to hurl at you in
return.”</p>

<p>In two hours they had covered a distance of several
miles. Nothing had been seen of peccaries, and
somewhat disheartened they came to a halt near the
bank of a mountain torrent which, at that point,
formed a pool several rods in extent.</p>

<p>“Hush!” said the professor suddenly. “Get
down behind the bushes. There is a fine shot for
all of us.”</p>

<p>They dropped down, and then gazed in the direction
he pointed out. Sitting on some tall bushes
overhanging the opposite side of the pool were a
number of birds almost as large as wild turkeys.
They were bluish in color, with a greenish tinge
under the throat fading to white. On the head of
each was a crest of yellow which looked like gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>“What beauties!” murmured Sam.</p>

<p>“Ready, all of you,” came from the professor.
“Take aim. Fire!”</p>

<p>The word was not yet out of his mouth when the
birds became alarmed and started to rise. But at
the volley two dropped into the water dead while
two others fluttered helplessly among the trees. The
professor and Mark ran after the latter and after
some trouble put them to death and brought them
in. In the meantime those in the pool were also
secured.</p>

<p>“These birds are crested curassows, or hoccos,”
said the professor. “Some of them are the color
of those we have shot but the majority are black.
They are very numerous in Venezuela, Guiana, and
Brazil, and a great many people keep them as we do
tame turkeys, and the meat is very much the same.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah for the turkey meat!” exclaimed Frank.
“That will be a change from our fish diet.”</p>

<p>With the curassows slung over their backs they
proceeded on their way, around the pool and up the
mountain torrent, to where there was a small stretch
of table-land. From this point they could obtain a
clear view of the surrounding country for many
miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>“There is the Orinoco,” said Mark, pointing to
the stream as it glistened in the sunlight. “But
the hill is between us and our camp.”</p>

<p>On the table-land they brought down a score of
birds, including a trogon, a beautiful creature of
black, green and gold, with long, sweeping tail; a
pair of birds of the sparrow-hawk variety; and several
humming-birds.</p>

<p>“These humming-birds are called the ruby and
topaz,” said Professor Strong. “They are hunted
down by the thousands each year and are used in the
decoration, principally, of ladies’ hats.”</p>

<p>“They are certainly pretty,” said Sam. “But
what a shame to slaughter them in such a wholesale
fashion.”</p>

<p>“All sorts of tropical birds are slaughtered merely
for the purposes of the milliner,” went on the professor.
“It is certainly a shame, but so long as the
ladies demand feathers on their hats the slaughter
will probably continue.”</p>

<p>Leaving the table-land they plunged again into
the forest. The professor had found tracks which
he felt certain belonged to some wild animals, and
as they advanced each held his gun ready for use
should the occasion require.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>The occasion was not long in coming. Directly
in front of them was a fallen tree, a veritable monarch
of the forest, all of nine feet in diameter and
with branches spreading in all directions. As they
were making their way around the roots of this tree
they heard a low snarl of rage and saw a wild beast
not unlike a huge cat leap from the roots with
another wild beast in its mouth.</p>

<p>Crack! went the professor’s rifle and the bullet
hit the beast in the forepaw. At once it dropped
its prey—an armadillo—and faced around with
another snarl of rage more fierce than ever.</p>

<p>“He’s coming for us!” yelled Mark, and fired
his own gun. But his aim was not true and the
bullet merely grazed the beast’s tail.</p>

<p>By this time the ocelot—for such the animal
proved to be—was up on the tree trunk, glaring directly
down upon them. He was closer to Frank
than to anyone else, and it looked as if he would leap
upon the youth without further delay.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that Frank was badly frightened.
But he did not lose his total presence of
mind, and almost mechanically he lifted the shotgun
he carried and blazed away. At the same time
Sam and Darry fired, and between the three the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
ocelot was mortally wounded and rolled to the
ground, growling and snarling in a fashion fearful
to contemplate. Then the professor rushed in and
with a shot at short range finished the beast.</p>

<p>“Say, but that was a close call all around,” came
from Mark, when the excitement was over.</p>

<p>“That’s what it was,” returned Frank, breathing
heavily. “I don’t want to get in such close quarters
again. I thought sure he was going to nab
me.”</p>

<p>The professor was much vexed that his first shot
had not killed the ocelot. “I must be getting rusty
in my shooting,” he said.</p>

<p>The armadillo was limping away on three legs,
for the ocelot had bitten it severely through the
hind quarters. But before it could get very far,
Darry and Sam went after it and brought it low.
Then they dragged it back by its tail and laid it beside
the larger beast.</p>

<p>The ocelot was a beautiful specimen, measuring
four feet from nose to tip of tail. It was of a greyish
fawn color, with stripes and patches of black.
The eyes were yellowish brown, full and round. The
boys could well imagine how they might glitter in
the darkness of night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>“This creature belongs to the leopard family,”
said the professor, while reloading his rifle. “They
are very powerful, and frequently attack animals
twice their size. There are a number of varieties,
and some go by the common name of tiger cats.
The skins are very valuable for rugs and other purposes.”</p>

<p>“What about the meat?” questioned Darry.</p>

<p>“The natives eat the meat of almost every wild
beast. Personally I have never tried ocelot steaks,
although I have been told they are fairly good eating.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII<br />

<small>MONKEYS AND A CANOE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the bringing down of the ocelot several
days passed without anything unusual happening.
The boys went hunting and fishing to their heart’s
content and brought down many small animals, but
nothing of great importance outside of a pair of
peccaries, which were found in a hollow tree by Sam
and brought down by him and Darry. The peccary
proved to be sweet eating, and Cubara was particularly
pleased to get the meat.</p>

<p>“Werry nice him,” he said. “Love him werry
much. Eat him ev’ry day fo’ many, many moons.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you could,” answered Darry. “But I’d
get mighty sick of it in a couple of days.”</p>

<p>Frank and Mark had been planning to go hunting
on their own account, further up the river, and at
last obtained the professor’s permission to use the
canoe for that purpose.</p>

<p>“But you must be very careful, boys,” said Professor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
Strong. “Do not go ashore unless you are
sure of your ground, and come back before sunset.”</p>

<p>“We’ll remember,” said Frank. “We only want
to go along the river bank for a mile or two.”</p>

<p>In coming up to the camp both Frank and Mark
had taken instructions from Cubara concerning the
handling of the canoe, so they had no difficulty in
embarking and paddling up the river, which so far
as eye could reach was as smooth as a mill-pond excepting
where the mountain torrent ran into it over
the bluff.</p>

<p>“If only we can bring down a puma or something
like that,” said Frank, as they left the camp behind.
“Won’t the others be envious!”</p>

<p>“We’d have our hands full with a puma I’m thinking,”
returned Mark. “Why they are just like the
panthers of our own country. We had better try
for something smaller first.”</p>

<p>The camp was soon out of sight, around a turn of
the stream, and then they pulled in close to shore, to
see if they could find any trace of something worth
shooting.</p>

<p>“This is slow,” remarked Mark, after a long silence,
during which they had paddled the best part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
a mile. “I haven’t seen a single thing worth mentioning.”</p>

<p>“Nor I. I have half a mind to throw a line overboard
and go fishing,” replied Frank.</p>

<p>“All right, do so, and I’ll paddle for awhile.”</p>

<p>The line was baited and thrown into the water.
Scarcely had it sunk a yard when there came a nibble
and a pull which almost caused Frank to go overboard.</p>

<p>“I’ve got something big now!” gasped Frank,
holding on to the line with one hand and the canoe
seat with the other.</p>

<p>“What is it?” questioned Mark, quickly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but it pulls like a whale.”</p>

<p>“Let me help you,” continued Mark, and dropped
the paddle on the bottom of the canoe. Then both
tried to haul in the line, but before they could do so
there was a swish in the water and a big, black object
appeared for a moment, a black object with a
greenish head and sharp greenish eyes. At this both
lads fell back in dismay.</p>

<p>“A water snake!” cried Mark. “And a big one,
too. Better cut him loose.”</p>

<p>The canoe was now spinning up the stream,
dragged by the snake who showed his head with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
fishhook caught in one side close to the eye. That
the reptile was angry and ready to fight there could
be no doubt.</p>

<p>As quickly as he could Frank brought out his knife
and sawed away at the line. As it parted the snake
came up again, lifting his head into the canoe and
hissing viciously. Then he glided along the side of
the craft, bent upon attacking Frank.</p>

<p>Mark had his gun handy and quick as a flash he
caught up the weapon. Bang! went the gun, and
the water snake caught the charge full in the face.
With a wild flapping he arose in the air, whipped
his slimy body across Frank’s leg and sank out of
sight into the river.</p>

<p>For the moment the boys gazed after the reptile
in a horror that no words can express. Frank had
sunk on the seat trembling in every joint and Mark
was equally affected.</p>

<p>“Is he—he dead?” came at last from the younger
youth.</p>

<p>“Guess he is,” answered Mark, in a hoarse voice.
“Anyway he’s gone, and so is the fishing line.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care about the line, Mark. Wasn’t he
awful?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>“That’s what he was, Frank—the nastiest thing
I ever saw in my life.”</p>

<p>“That settles fishing for me. I wouldn’t want to
catch another water snake for a million dollars!”</p>

<p>It was fully five minutes before they continued on
their way, and then they did so quietly, as if afraid
a noise might bring the reptile after them again.
But the snake failed to re-appear and soon they were
a mile or more away from the spot.</p>

<p>Just before encountering the snake they had
noticed a tribe of monkeys on the shore, watching
them intently. The monkeys had followed them for
a short distance but had dropped out of sight as
soon as the water snake appeared.</p>

<p>“There come the monkeys again,” said Mark,
presently, and he was right. With a strange shrieking
and howling they pushed some brushwood aside
and came close to the water’s edge, where they
squatted in a long row, eyeing the canoe in a wondering
manner and occasionally reaching out a paw
as if beckoning the craft to come closer.</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” said Frank, mockingly. “We
don’t care to trust ourselves in your hands.”</p>

<p>As they pushed up the river the monkeys followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
them, still howling, sometimes singly and then in a
deafening chorus.</p>

<p>“There is this much about it,” said Frank, as he
gazed at the creatures, which numbered fully a hundred.
“I don’t want to land while they are around.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” answered his chum. “But we’ve got
to land soon, or else go back. We’re at least six or
seven miles from camp now, and that’s far enough.”</p>

<p>“Supposing I give them a shot?”</p>

<p>“All right, blaze away, but don’t hurt too many
of them.”</p>

<p>The shotgun was discharged and one monkey was
killed and several wounded. Instantly the others
set up a fearful screeching and fled in dismay,
through the jungle, until their howling was lost in
the distance.</p>

<p>Pushing up the river a little further, the two boys
landed and pulled their craft partly out of the water.
They looked around cautiously but the only living
creatures that appeared were a few birds and they
kept at a safe distance.</p>

<p>“There seems to be a sort of open trail to the
northward,” said Mark. “Supposing we follow
that? I haven’t any fancy for the jungle itself.”</p>

<p>Frank was willing, and soon they were tramping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
the trail, which led up a hill and around a series of
rocks overgrown with gigantic ferns and vines.</p>

<p>“What a peculiar smell,” said Mark, after they
had passed the rocks. “Smells for all the world like
the root beer we drink at home.”</p>

<p>“I know what it is,” answered his chum. “It’s a
sassafras grove we are entering. The professor was
telling me of them. They are common here and so
are other barks that druggists use.”</p>

<p>A little while later they sighted several small animals,
not unlike hares, which crossed their pathway
so rapidly that they could not get a shot at the creatures.
Then they came to a flock of curassows and
by skillful maneuvering got so close that they
brought down three before the birds knew enough to
take to flight.</p>

<p>“Anyway we’ve got something for our trouble,”
said Frank. “I was beginning to think we’d have
to go back empty-handed. If we—— What’s
that?”</p>

<p>The youth broke off short and looked inquiringly
at his chum. From a distance had come a peculiar
roar, not unlike that of a lion or tiger.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it’s a puma,” said Mark. “Hark! It’s
coming closer!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>They listened once more, and as the sound was
repeated, each drew up his gun in readiness to fire.
Then they heard a savage snarl, followed by a
screeching and yelping.</p>

<p>“Two wild animals fighting,” said Frank. “My
how they must be chewing each other up!”</p>

<p>They continued to listen and gradually the sounds
became fainter and fainter. Then came a final roar
and all became quiet.</p>

<p>“One of them has been killed,” said Mark.</p>

<p>“Yes, and the roaring beast is the victor,” answered
Frank. “Shall we go ahead and try to find
out what it is?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know what it is, but I don’t want to
run any risk. If it’s a lion—”</p>

<p>“There are no lions here, Frank. But it may be
a jaguar, and they are almost as dangerous.”</p>

<p>“In that case we had better be careful. We don’t
want to be chewed up. Let us rest here in the open
for a bit and see if he comes this way.”</p>

<p>This was agreed to, and sitting on a rock they
waited, each with his gun ready for use. Quarter of
an hour slipped by, which seemed much longer to
both boys. Then came a howling from the direction
of the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>“Those rascally monkeys are coming back!” exclaimed
Mark. “I hope they don’t come this way.
We might have lots of trouble with them if they
got to throwing stones at us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we can give them a shot or two if they do
that.”</p>

<p>“They seem to be having quite a time of it along
the river. By ginger! do you think they’d bother
our canoe?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so! Let’s go down and see if the boat
is safe!”</p>

<p>Much alarmed the two boys caught up the birds
they had shot and started down the hill on the back
trail. The road was plain so there was no danger
of getting lost. Mark ran ahead and was the first
to catch sight of the Orinoco at the spot where they
had left their craft.</p>

<p>The sight that met his gaze filled him with dismay.
The shore was lined with howling monkeys
who filled the air with their noise. Out in the
stream were a score of the creatures on the canoe,
howling with equal vigor. The paddles to the craft
had been dropped overboard and the canoe was
floating at the mercy of the wind and current.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX<br />

<small>LOST ON THE ORINOCO</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Well</span> did you ever see such impudent beggars!”
cried Mark, as Frank reached his side. “If they
haven’t gone and taken possession of our canoe!”</p>

<p>“O Mark, we must get it back somehow!” ejaculated
Frank, aghast. “If we don’t, how will we ever
get back to camp?”</p>

<p>“Of course we must get it back. But how to do
it I don’t know. Come, let us run down the stream
a bit and try to head them off.”</p>

<p>Frank was willing enough to do anything which
might give them back the canoe and away they
started, as close to the bank of the stream as the
jungle permitted.</p>

<p>But the way was dark and uncertain, for the sun
was now hanging over the forest to the westward,
and they had not gone far when Frank went into a
boggy hole up to his knees. As he sank his gun
went off, the charge luckily passing upward through
the tree branches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>“What’s up?” called Mark, who had gone ahead
by a somewhat different route.</p>

<p>“I’m in a hole! Help me out!”</p>

<p>“I will!”</p>

<p>Mark was soon at his chum’s side and Frank was
helped from the hole without much difficulty. But
his going down had disturbed a number of ugly
looking spiders and one of these bit him on the hand
before he could brush the creature away.</p>

<p>“Ough!” cried the boy, for the pain was intense.</p>

<p>“Did it bite you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Too bad! But come on, or those monkeys and
the canoe will be gone.”</p>

<p>For the moment the bite of the spider, though
smarting hotly, was forgotten and side by side they
continued along the watercourse until they reached
an inlet. Close to the river this inlet was all of
fifty feet across and they had to make a long detour
in order to avoid the many bog holes with which it
was surrounded. All this took time and when they
reached the Orinoco again the canoe with its load
of monkeys was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>“It’s gone!” burst out Mark. “I can’t see the
canoe anywhere.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>“Perhaps they are already around the bend,” suggested
Frank. “Let us try for a short cut. It’s
our only chance.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he kept whipping his hand in the air,
showing the pain he was suffering. Already the
skin around the bite was beginning to swell.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad, Frank,” said Mark, sympathetically.
“Put some soft mud on it. I’ve heard that is good
for bee and spider bites,” and his chum did as suggested.
This lessened the pain but the swelling
steadily continued.</p>

<p>On they went through the jungle, keeping close together,
for here it was darker than ever. Both
thought they knew the course they were pursuing and
that they would regain the stream at a point half
a mile below where they had left it. They made no
allowance for the fact that it is the easiest thing in
the world to become completely turned around in
any dense mass of growth where one has to turn
this way and that in order to make progress of any
sort. Old hunters are often bothered even in woods
which they think they know thoroughly.</p>

<p>A half mile was covered when both came to a halt
in dismay. Instead of sighting the Orinoco they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
found before them a cliff of rocks twenty to thirty
feet in height.</p>

<p>“Hullo, we’ve made a mistake!” burst out Mark.</p>

<p>“The river can’t be in this direction,” answered
Frank. “We have got turned around somehow.”</p>

<p>“Well, the river ought to be on our right.”</p>

<p>“So it had. Let us turn in that direction.”</p>

<p>Again they went on, fairly tearing their course
through the entangling vines and over the rough
roots of trees, sprawling in all directions.</p>

<p>“I—I can’t go much further,” panted Frank. “I—I’m
out of wind.”</p>

<p>“I’m pretty well blown myself,” was the reply.
“But we ought to be close to the river. Shall I go
ahead and look?”</p>

<p>“No! no! don’t leave me!”</p>

<p>Frank moved on again, tired as he was, and thus
several rods more were covered.</p>

<p>“Water! The river!” cried Mark, and made a
wild dash forward. But alas! it was not the Orinoco
at all, only a long and shallow pool having apparently
no outlet. Around the pool were a big flock
of birds of every color imaginable, but the boys
never thought to fire into the game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>“We are on the wrong tack again!” groaned
Mark. “I don’t believe the river is anywhere near
here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mark, if that is so, we are lost!”</p>

<p><i>Lost!</i> It was a horrifying word. Were they
really lost in that immense jungle, perhaps miles
away from where they had left their companions?
The face of each whitened and Frank sank down on
a tree root in despair.</p>

<p>“Yes, we must be lost!” he murmured. “And if
we are, how will we ever find our way back to
camp?”</p>

<p>“We must find our way back—we simply must!”
was Mark’s reply. “The river can’t be so very far
off.”</p>

<p>“But the canoe is gone. We won’t get that back.
It must be miles from here by this time,” insisted
Frank.</p>

<p>“Well, if it’s gone we’ll have to tramp back, that’s
all, Frank. I know it’s a long way, and not a very
inviting way either, but there is nothing else
to do.”</p>

<p>The sun was now setting and the blackness of
night began to creep swiftly over the immense forest.
Still further alarmed, they pushed on until, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
warning, Frank fell headlong and lay like a log.
Mark raised him up and saw that the hand which had
been bitten by the spider was swollen to twice its
size and that the swelling was beginning to creep
up the arm.</p>

<p>“He is poisoned, that’s all there is to that,”
thought Mark. “Perhaps it will kill him.”</p>

<p>The thought of his chum dying there, on his hands,
in that lonely place, made him frantic. He tore off
the handkerchief Frank had placed on his hand and
brushed the soft mud from the bite. He had heard
how poison can sometimes be sucked from a wound
and now he set to work fearlessly, not thinking of
himself, but only praying mentally that the action
would restore Frank to consciousness.</p>

<p>The hours of the night to follow were such that
Mark, if he lives a hundred years, will never forget.
After sucking the bite thoroughly, he plastered it
with fresh mud and bound it up again. Then, carrying
Frank to the edge of the pool, he lit a camp-fire,
to keep off any wild beasts that might be prowling
in the vicinity. He bathed his chum’s face and raised
him up. At first Frank did not respond to this
treatment but at last he opened his eyes and stared
around in bewilderment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>“Frank! Frank! wake up!” cried Mark
“Please try to rouse yourself.”</p>

<p>“Wha—what happened to me?” was the uncertain
question.</p>

<p>“You fell unconscious, don’t you remember? I
guess it was the spider bite did it. Please rouse
up.” And as Frank tried to settle back once more
Mark shook him vigorously.</p>

<p>It was all of two hours before Frank roused up
sufficiently to stand on his feet. His eyes were much
swollen and he felt sick at his stomach. But the
poison had now spent its force and from that time
on he grew gradually better. But the swelling of his
hand remained for several days.</p>

<p>The night passed without sleep on Mark’s part,
for he was afraid to leave off watching Frank. To
pass the early morning hours, Mark dressed one of
the curassows, covered it with mud, as he had been
taught by Cubara, and placed it in the hot ashes of
the fire to bake. By the time the sun came up the
bird was done and to Mark it proved delicious eating,
although Frank declared he could taste nothing on
account of the poison still in his system.</p>

<p>“I’m as weak as a rag,” declared the younger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
boy. “When I stand up my legs fairly tremble
under me.”</p>

<p>“Then we had better not attempt to do too much
to-day,” answered Mark, trying to speak cheerfully.</p>

<p>“But we must get back to camp, Mark. What
will they think of our absence?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know. But getting back will
not be so easy. Remember, we must first locate
the river.”</p>

<p>“We ought to be able to do that by the position
of the sun.”</p>

<p>“I thought of that. But I’d rather climb up one
of these big trees and take a look around.”</p>

<p>“All right,—if you can get up.” Frank gazed
along the trunk of one of the monsters. “It will be
no easy task.”</p>

<p>“The vines will aid me,” answered Mark, and
made his preparations to ascend the tree without
further delay.</p>

<p>As Frank had said, it was no easy task, and it was
fully quarter of an hour before Mark was half way
to the top of the giant of the jungle.</p>

<p>“Can you see anything?” called up Frank.</p>

<p>“Not yet, but I am getting on a level with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
trees around this one,” was the reply. Mark continued
to climb. It was now easier work, for at the
top of the tree the branches were closer together than
they were below.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! the river!” came the cry. “Frank, we
are not so far away from it after all.”</p>

<p>“In what direction?” demanded the younger
boy.</p>

<p>“To the northward. We have become badly
turned around I can tell you.”</p>

<p>“Do you see anything of the camp?”</p>

<p>“No, that is too far off. But if we can only get
to the river bank we’ll be sure to strike the camp
sooner or later,” went on Mark. “I’ll come down as
soon——”</p>

<p>Mark broke off short, as a peculiar noise just below
him caught his ear. Looking down he saw a
strange looking creature sitting on a branch, gazing
fiercely at him, a creature covered with black and
white quills and with a scaly tail that wound itself
several times around the branch behind it. The animal
was a coendoo, commonly called a South American
porcupine.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXX<br />

<small>IN THE DEPTHS OF THE JUNGLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ordinarily</span> the South American porcupine or
coendoo is a timid animal, seeking cover by day
and hunting its food during the night. It lives upon
nuts, roots, herbs and leaves and, unlike other porcupines
which burrow in the ground, makes its
home, to a great extent, in the branches and hollows
of large trees.</p>

<p>But though usually timid it is at times aroused
to great anger, especially when startled. Such was
now the case with the beast that confronted Mark.
Every quill, or spine, was raised to its fullest and
the porcupine emitted a strange hissing whistle
which bode the youth no good.</p>

<p>Mark was startled, so much so that he slipped
from the branch upon which he stood and came
close to pitching to the ground head first. But he
caught another branch and with an effort swung
himself up to a sitting position.</p>

<p>“Are you coming down?” called out Frank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>“I can’t! Here’s a porcupine, or something like
it. He looks as if he was going to attack me.”</p>

<p>As Mark spoke he felt in his pocket for his pistol
and brought the weapon forth. It was fully loaded
and he pointed it at the coendoo, which was now
moving slowly backward as though to prepare for a
leap upon him.</p>

<p>Crack! went the pistol and the porcupine was
struck a glancing blow over the back. Then it made
its leap, landing on Mark’s breast!</p>

<p>For the instant the youth was almost paralyzed
with fright. But mechanically he discharged his
pistol a second time and the bullet lodged in the
coendoo’s breast. With a howl of pain it fell back,
caught at the tree branch with its tail and missed
it, and went plunging out of sight into the foliage
and vines below.</p>

<p>“Did you kill it?” called out Frank.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. It fell down. Look out it don’t
come on your head,” answered Mark.</p>

<p>Frank already had his gun in hand, ready to be
of service to his chum if possible. But the porcupine
failed to appear and he called back that it must still
be in the foliage of the tree.</p>

<p>With great caution Mark descended one branch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
after another. Presently he caught sight of the animal,
hanging from a limb by its tail, an appendage
which in the coendoo is unusually strong and long.
The beast was plainly dying but to make certain
Mark put another bullet through it. Then with the
butt of the pistol he unwound the tail and the carcass
fell to the ground with a thud.</p>

<p>“That was a surprise party I didn’t expect,” said
Mark, when he was once more beside Frank. “How
he scared me when he leaped at me! See, his quills
drew blood,” and he showed the back of his pricked
hand.</p>

<p>“Wonder if the porcupine is good eating?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been told the meat is like that of a suckling
pig. We’ll skin him and take him along. Who
knows but what we may need the meat badly before
we get out of our mess.”</p>

<p>It was a difficult task to skin the coendoo and it
caused them more than one wound. But at last
it was finished, and with their game over their
shoulders and their guns in hand, they started out in
the direction of the stream Mark had located from
the tree top.</p>

<p>The day proved an extremely hot one and the
boys had not covered half the distance when they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
found they had to sit down and rest. On all sides
was the trackless jungle: trees, bushes and vines,
with an occasional opening, where grew the most
gorgeous of ferns and flowers. Where the ground
was damp, monstrous toadstools reared their umbrella-like
heads and the moss was six to eight inches
deep. Insects of a hundred varieties were numerous
and among them crawled lizards and other small
creatures for which they could find no name. Orchids
abounded, some entwining around the trees
to a great height. The odor was so strong at times
as to be positively sickening.</p>

<p>“They say that some of these orchids can put
you in a sleep from which you will never awaken,”
said Mark. “I don’t know if it’s true or not, but
if we have to sleep in the open another night let us
take good care to keep away from anything that
smells as strong as that plant yonder.”</p>

<p>“I heard the professor tell that one orchid produces
vanilla,” said Frank. “He said there were
over three thousand varieties of the plant.”</p>

<p>Again the forward march was resumed and when
both were almost too tired to fight their way another
step a river came into sight, flowing lazily along in
the sultry daylight. Both looked at the water for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
minute in silence then turned to each other in perplexity.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look like the Orinoco,” declared
Frank. “At least, not like the part just above the
camp.”</p>

<p>“Exactly what I was thinking, Frank. I believe
we’ve struck another stream entirely.”</p>

<p>“Then we are worse lost than we were before.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not. This may be a tributary of the
Orinoco. If so, by following this we are bound to
find the Orinoco itself sooner or later.”</p>

<p>“True, but this may flow along for miles before
it joins the Orinoco, and if it does join that stream,
the question is: Does it join above or below the
camp?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I can’t answer that question, now. The
only thing we can do is to follow this stream and
trust to luck.”</p>

<p>“If only we had a canoe!”</p>

<p>“True, but we haven’t one, and no tools with
which to even make a raft. We’ll have to keep on
hoofing it, as the saying goes.”</p>

<p>They had brought with them the remains of the
baked curassow and on this they now proceeded to
make a dinner. Both longed for some bread and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
vegetables. They were afraid to touch the berries
and other things growing around them for fear of
being poisoned.</p>

<p>By throwing some brushwood into the stream they
soon made certain of the direction of the current
and this accomplished set off once more, after washing
down the fowl meat with the coolest drink of
water they could find. Fortunately the bank of the
stream was tolerably clear of bushes so they made
much more rapid progress than before.</p>

<p>“I have an idea,” said Frank, as they moved
around a bend into which a mass of driftwood had
collected. “Do you see yonder tree trunk, caught
in the mud? Why can’t we shove that out into the
water and take a ride? It will rest us, and I think
the trunk will move just about as fast as we can
walk, when once it gets started.”</p>

<p>“I’m willing to try it,” answered Mark, and they
set to work to dislodge the tree, which looked as if
it had been in the water for some time. Once loose
they sprang “aboard,” as Frank called it, and shoved
into the stream proper. Caught by the current the
tree trunk swung along the surface of the watercourse
more rapidly than they had anticipated.</p>

<p>“This is something like,” cried Frank, seating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
himself on one of the upmost branches. “It’s every
bit as good as a canoe.”</p>

<p>“If it don’t take a notion to turn over and dump
us into the stream,” answered Mark. “It seems to
me it’s a little shaky.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he, too, was satisfied and sitting side
by side they allowed the tree to carry them down the
river. Soon several miles were covered and then
they noticed that the watercourse was growing narrower
and that the current was correspondingly
stronger.</p>

<p>“My, but we are flying along now,” remarked
Frank.</p>

<p>“Perhaps we had better try to steer the tree into
shore,” returned Mark. “I don’t like this increase
in speed. We may be drifting toward some rapids or
a waterfall.”</p>

<p>He had hardly spoken when the tree whirled
around, almost sending both in the water. As they
clutched at the branches they felt the speed increase.
The river was now not more than a quarter of its
former width and the water foamed up here and
there, showing that there were rocks not far below
the surface. Rocks could also be seen along the
shores and presently they passed a tall cliff filled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
with birds, the flock swooping off in several directions
at their approach.</p>

<p>“I hear water falling ahead!” ejaculated Frank.
“Hark!”</p>

<p>“Yes! yes! We are coming to a waterfall!”
burst out Mark. “Let us try to turn the tree into
shore by all means. If we don’t we may be
drowned!”</p>

<p>Each had a tree branch in his hand, with which
he had been trying to paddle from time to time.
Now both endeavored to use the tree branches as
rudders, but in a trice Mark’s was caught in some
rocks and torn from his grasp. A second later the
tree bounced up and spun around, throwing the boys
flat among the branches. Dazed and bewildered they
clung fast, fearing that the next lurch of the tree
would send them into the stream, which now foamed
and boiled on all sides of them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXI<br />

<small>HOCKLEY AND THE BOA-CONSTRICTOR</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">It</span> is high time the boys came back.”</p>

<p>So spoke Professor Strong, on the evening following
the departure of Frank and Mark up the Orinoco.
It was after nine o’clock, and all was silent
around the camp save for the distant cries of the
night birds and the howling of the monkeys. The
professor stood on the edge of the bluff, gazing
anxiously through the gloom that overhung the broad
watercourse.</p>

<p>“It is odd they are not back,” said Darry, who
was close at hand. “I hope no harm has befallen
them.”</p>

<p>Hockley had already thrown himself down in
the tent and was fast asleep, despite a plague of gnats
which had but recently put in an appearance. Sam
sat by the fire sewing up a hole he had torn in his
jacket. The Indian was at the water’s edge, fishing
with a net he had made of braided vines.</p>

<p>As the time slipped by Professor Strong, Darry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
and Sam grew more anxious and none of them felt
like going to sleep. The Indian came in and threw
himself down and then the others sat down to talk
in whispers.</p>

<p>By daybreak the professor had made up his mind
to go after the missing ones. He decided to take Cubara
with him, leaving the others to watch the camp.</p>

<p>“If I find the boys I’ll be back before dinner
time,” said Professor Strong. “If not, I won’t return
until they are found.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sure I hope you have quick luck,” said
Sam. “We’ll be very anxious until you return.”</p>

<p>Soon the professor and the Indian were out of
sight and the boys turned back to put the camp in
order. Hockley threw himself on a rock, declining
to take a hand in the work.</p>

<p>“You ought to do your share,” said Sam. “It’s
not fair to expect us to do everything.”</p>

<p>“You shut up!” cried Hockley. “I’ll do as I
please. If you say a word I’ll pitch into you!”</p>

<p>He was in an ill humor and spoiling for a fight, as
Darry and Sam could readily see. Yet Sam was
not daunted.</p>

<p>“It’s not fair, Hockley. Everybody ought to do
his share of the work,” he went on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>“Oh, leave him alone, Beans,” came from Darry.
“We can’t stop him from being lazy.”</p>

<p>The words had scarcely been uttered when the
angry youth, caught up a billet of wood and flung
it at Darry. It struck the lad in the shoulder hurting
him not a little. Darry rushed at him, but leaping
up with a club in his hands, Hockley stood on
guard.</p>

<p>“Leave me alone!” he exclaimed. “The first
of you to get too close will get a crack with this.”</p>

<p>“Let us both pitch into him,” came from Sam.
“He ought to have a first-class thrashing.”</p>

<p>“You let me alone!” howled Hockley. “Don’t
you dare to touch me!”</p>

<p>“Drop that club,” came from Darry. “Drop it,
I say, or Sam and I will certainly pitch into you
and you’ll get more than you want.”</p>

<p>“I—I won’t drop the club until you promise to let
me alone.”</p>

<p>“Why did you fling that piece of wood at me?”</p>

<p>“You hadn’t any right to jaw at me.”</p>

<p>“It was your business to do your share of the
work here.”</p>

<p>A war of words followed, and in the end Hockley
dropped the club and consented to do some of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
work. As soon as it was finished, he picked up his
gun and started to move off.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” demanded Darry. “The
professor told us to remain here until he got back.”</p>

<p>“I’m going down the river a bit. I reckon there’s
no harm in that,” answered Hockley and without
waiting for further argument he strode away and
was soon lost to sight in the jungle.</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t go off like that if he wasn’t boiling
mad,” observed Sam.</p>

<p>After cleaning up the two boys started in to fish,
there being nothing else by which to while away the
time. But biting was not lively, and after half an
hour of only fair success they walked up the bluff
again. They had just reached the tent when they
heard a gunshot, followed by a yell of fright.</p>

<p>“That’s Hockley!” ejaculated Darry. “He has
stirred up something and it has scared him to death.”</p>

<p>“Help! help!” came faintly to their ears.
“Help!”</p>

<p>“We had better go and see what is the matter,”
said Sam, and caught up a rifle. Darry had already
reached for a shotgun, and thus armed both boys
sped down the bluff again and in the direction from
whence the cries proceeded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>They had not far to go. Beyond the bend of the
stream was an inlet and back of this a somewhat
open glade, bordered by half a dozen low-drooping
rubber trees. Among these trees stood Hockley,
fairly paralyzed with terror and close at hand,
swinging from a branch, was a boa-constrictor all of
fifteen feet in length.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p290.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">“Help! save me!” screamed the unfortunate youth.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a snake!” burst out Darry, and then
stood still, hardly knowing whether to proceed or
not.</p>

<p>Sam said nothing, but brought his rifle to his
shoulder, took quick aim and pulled the trigger. The
bullet sped true and buried itself in the boa-constrictor’s
neck.</p>

<p>The shot awakened Darry to action and now he
too blazed away, peppering the big snake in the head
and body. The second shot from his gun was at
close range and fairly tore a piece of skin from the
huge reptile’s neck.</p>

<p>But a boa-constrictor is not easily killed, and
though badly wounded it yet had a great deal of
fight in it. Still holding to the tree branch with its
tail it shot forth its body and in an instant had Hockley
by the waist.</p>

<p>“Help! save me!” screamed the unfortunate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
youth. “Oh, please save me! Don’t let him crush
me to pieces!”</p>

<p>In an agony of fear he tried to pull himself loose,
but without avail. The snake lifted him up from
the ground with ease, intending doubtless to crush
him to a jelly on the tree trunk.</p>

<p>But now Sam rushed as close as had Darry. The
rifle was a repeating weapon—one of the best the
party possessed—and shoving it at the snake’s head
the youth let drive twice in quick succession. Then,
without waiting to see the effect of these shots, he put
two additional bullets in the boa-constrictor’s body.
The reptile quivered from head to tail then remained
motionless.</p>

<p>It was an anxious moment and the hearts of all
three boys seemed to stop beating. Hockley tried to
call out, but could not, for the boa-constrictor was
fairly crushing in his ribs.</p>

<p>But after that moment had passed the boys saw
that they had won the battle. The head of the boa-constrictor
dropped and the muscles of the huge body
relaxed. Then Hockley slipped to the damp earth
and slowly the reptile’s body dropped on top of
him.</p>

<p>“He must be dead,” whispered Darry, hoarsely,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
and with his gun started to release Hockley from the
loathsome weight. Sam assisted, and soon they had
him free and was dragging him out of harm’s way.
From a safe distance they watched the boa-constrictor
and at last felt certain that it was dead.</p>

<p>“He’s in a bad way,” said Sam, leaning over
Hockley. The youth lay in a heap, totally unconscious
and breathing with difficulty.</p>

<p>“It was awful,” returned Darry. “What a close
shave! Let us take him down to the river and bathe
his face.”</p>

<p>They did as suggested, but even this failed to revive
Hockley. Then Darry ran back to the camp
for some medicine which was administered with care.
But it was fully an hour before Hockley opened his
eyes.</p>

<p>“Take him off!” he moaned. “Take the horrible
thing off!”</p>

<p>“You’re safe now, Hockley,” said Darry, kindly.
“The boa-constrictor is dead.” But Hockley was
now out of his mind and did not understand, and
he continued to plead most piteously that they save
him from being crushed to death.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to carry him back to camp,” said
Sam, and this was done. It was no easy task to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
the hurt one up the bluff. Once in camp they fixed
Hockley a soft bed and did all they could to make him
otherwise comfortable.</p>

<p>“I never want to see another boa-constrictor, not
even in a menagerie,” declared Sam. “I’ll dream
of that thing for a week.”</p>

<p>The boys remained in camp after that. It was
nightfall before Hockley came to his senses and
then he complained of a severe pain in the chest.
They uncovered him and rubbed him down with liniment.</p>

<p>“Is it dead?” he asked. “How did you kill it?”
And when they told him he shook his head slowly,
as if in wonder. Later on he called them both to
him. “I’m much obliged for what you did,” he
said humbly. “It was great. I shan’t forget it.
I’m sorry we had the row.”</p>

<p>“So am I sorry,” returned Sam, and Darry
nodded to show he agreed. “We can’t afford to
quarrel out here, Jake. We may need each other’s
help, eh?”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I was thinking. I guess I was
a big fool to start it anyway. Let’s call it off, will
you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly!” cried Darry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>“With all my heart,” came from Sam.</p>

<p>Hockley took the hand of each and pressed it
briefly. He looked one and the other in the eyes
and then his gaze dropped. “All right, we’ll be
friends,” he said, in a lower voice than ever.</p>

<p>Nobody felt like talking after this. Darry started
up the fire and got out some things for dinner. Sam
brought up the fish and cleaned them. Hockley
turned over on his back and dozed away, occasionally
uttering a low groan. Yet every one of the lads felt
better because of what had just passed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXII<br />

<small>A PEEP AT GOLD AND SILVER MINES</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> tree is caught fast!”</p>

<p>“I know it, Frank, but I don’t think it will stay
caught for long!”</p>

<p>What the two chums said was true—the tree had
caught in the boiling and foaming water, directly in
the middle of the stream. The spray was flying all
about them, so that they could scarcely make out
what was ahead. But they heard a noise that could
mean but one thing. A waterfall was there, dashing
with a roar over the rocks and falling into a big
pool below.</p>

<p>A minute went by. The tree was swinging around
slowly. Now it began to grate along the rocks. Of
a sudden an end bobbed up and then the tree was free,
and on it rushed for the waterfall.</p>

<p>“We are going over!” shrieked Frank, and held
fast, not knowing exactly why. Mark tried to
answer, but the roar all around them drowned out
every other sound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>On they went for a hundred yards, between rocks
standing up higher than their heads. Then the
brink of the waterfall was gained and here the tree
seemed to pause for a moment. Over it went, carrying
the boys with it, over and down, out of the sunlight
into utter darkness.</p>

<p>By instinct more than reason both boys clung fast
to the tree and that was their salvation. Down they
went into the pool and the torrent of water came on
top of them, sending them far beneath the surface.
How long they remained under they could not tell,
afterward, but it seemed an age. When they came
up each was more dead than alive. But still they
clung to the tree as it drifted away and lodged among
the rocks a short distance further down the river.</p>

<p>“Frank, are you all right?” Mark asked the question,
feebly, some ten minutes later.</p>

<p>“I—I guess so,” was the gasped out answer.
“But, oh, Mark, wasn’t it an awful tumble?”</p>

<p>“That’s what it was, Frank. I didn’t think we’d
come out of it alive.”</p>

<p>They left the tree and sat down on the rocks, and
there rested for over an hour. The noise of the
waterfall still thundered in their ears, but otherwise
all was silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>At last Mark arose and stretched himself. “If
we are all right we may as well go on again,” he
said.</p>

<p>“On the tree?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I don’t think there is any danger of another
waterfall—at least not close by. We can watch
the water and if the current gets too swift we can
turn into shore before the tree gets beyond our
control again.”</p>

<p>So it was agreed, and soon they were on the way
once more. Below the falls the river was narrow
for several miles but the current was not very swift,
for much of the water was carried off by side
streams flowing in various directions.</p>

<p>“We don’t seem to be getting to the Orinoco very
fast,” observed Frank, after all of five miles had
been covered. “I’ll wager we are at least twenty
to thirty miles from camp.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we are. But what do you advise? We
can’t sit down here and suck our thumbs.”</p>

<p>“Hark! What was that? A gunshot?”</p>

<p>“It sounded more like a distant explosion,”
cried Mark, leaping to his feet. “There it goes
again. An explosion sure enough. What can it
mean?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>“I think I know,” answered Frank. “It means
that we are near some kind of a mine. That was the
blasting of rocks.”</p>

<p>“I hope you are right, Frank. It came from down
the river, didn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It did. Let us go on. There may be a regular
miners’ camp below here.”</p>

<p>Once more they allowed their improvised craft to
drift down the stream. The character of the country
was changing, and presently they found themselves
hemmed in by high rocky walls. Then came
a bend eastward and they came in sight of a small
settlement. There were a dozen houses built of
timber covered with corrugated iron, and a small
engine house with a tall iron smokestack. Back of
the settlement were the openings to several gold and
silver mines. As they approached another explosion
rent the air and they saw a large section of a cliff
give way and fall to the rocks below.</p>

<p>There were several boats tied up to a tiny dock
running along the river, and the men on these gazed
curiously at the boys as they drifted up and leaped
aboard one of the craft.</p>

<p>“Where come you from?” demanded one of the
men, in Spanish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>“We are American,” said Mark. “Can you
speak English?”</p>

<p>“Americans, eh?” put in another man. “I’m
an American myself. How did you get on that
tree?”</p>

<p>“It’s a long story,” answered Mark. “We were
with a party along the Orinoco but we went ashore
and got lost. Are we far from that river?”</p>

<p>“Eight miles. You look pretty wet.”</p>

<p>“We came over the falls.”</p>

<p>“Gee whiz! It’s a wonder you are alive!” burst
out the American, whose name was Simon Smither.
“Come ashore, and I’ll take you to the boss. This
place is Castroville. Maybe you’ve heard of it. We
have here the Little Bolivar and the Moonlight
Mines, two of the best payers in this section of the
country.”</p>

<p>“Castroville!” ejaculated Frank. He remembered
that Andy Hume had once mentioned the place
to him. “Is there a newcomer here by the name
of Andy Hume?”</p>

<p>“There is. He’s up to the office now. So you
know him?”</p>

<p>“We do,” answered Mark, and then told their
story while the whole party hurried from the river<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
to where the offices of the mines were located, not
far from the engine house.</p>

<p>Andy Hume saw them coming and leaped up from
a stool to receive them. “I declare,” he cried.
“Where did you come from? Thought you were
hunting and fishing along the Orinoco.”</p>

<p>“We were,” answered Frank, and told of how
they had become lost and of what had followed.
“We must get back as soon as we can,” he added.
“The professor and the others will be much worried
over our absence.”</p>

<p>The matter was talked over, and by consulting one
of the managers of the mines they obtained permission
to use one of the boats, taking with them a
native boatman who knew all the rivers of the
vicinity thoroughly.</p>

<p>“He’ll get you back safe and sound,” said Andy
Hume. “He’s a first rate fellow. He brought me
here from Navaleno, forty miles away.”</p>

<p>“But how did you happen to come here?” questioned
Mark. “I thought you were going prospecting?”</p>

<p>“So I was, but at Navaleno I met an old miner
friend of mine, Captain Richards. He has an interest
here and he wants me to look after it while he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
takes a trip to the States. So I’m booked here at a
salary of two hundred dollars per month and found.
Not so bad that, eh?” And the boys agreed that
the arrangement was certainly very promising.</p>

<p>A comfortable meal and a chance to dry their
clothing made both boys feel much better. While
they were eating they asked a number of questions
about the mines and when they had finished Andy
Hume insisted upon showing them around.</p>

<p>“The output of these mines will be about six hundred
thousand dollars this year,” he said. “To get
out the gold and silver will cost the combined companies
about two hundred thousand dollars, leaving
a profit to the stockholders of four hundred thousand
dollars. We have here all the latest machinery
with the exception of a newly-patented quartz
crusher which is now being built for us in the
United States. At first the mining around here was
what is commonly called cradling or placer mining,—that
is, the miners would pick up what they could
find on the surface or by ordinary digging—but that
is past and all we get has to be blasted out of the
mountains.”</p>

<p>An hour was spent in and around the mines, inspecting
the shafts and the various machines for extracting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
the gold and silver. Then the boatman
came up to announce that the boat was ready and
they started to leave.</p>

<p>As they did so a strange boat, containing several
passengers, arrived at the dock close at hand. As
the passengers came toward where Frank and Mark
were standing, the latter plucked the former hurriedly
by the sleeve.</p>

<p>“See there, Frank,” he whispered.</p>

<p>Frank looked in the direction and gave a start.</p>

<p>“Why it’s that Dan Markel, the fellow who
robbed Hockley!” he ejaculated.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIII<br />

<small>TOGETHER AGAIN—CONCLUSION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> two boys were much surprised by the unexpected
appearance of the man from Baltimore and
for the moment knew not what to say or do.</p>

<p>“Do you know one of those men?” asked Andy
Hume.</p>

<p>“Yes, that one,” answered Mark, pointing out the
wrong-doer. “His name is Dan Markel, and he
robbed Jacob Hockley of his watch and nearly all of
his money.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say! Then he won’t be the fellow we
want here.”</p>

<p>By this time Markel was close at hand. Now for
the first time he caught sight of the boys and he
halted in dismay.</p>

<p>“So we’ve met again,” said Mark, coldly.</p>

<p>“Why—er—how are you?” stammered the man
from Baltimore. He knew not what to say.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ve got Jake Hockley’s watch with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
you,” put in Frank. “If you have, you had better
pass it over to us.”</p>

<p>“You—er—you talk in riddles,” returned Markel.
“I know nothing of his watch excepting that it was
taken from him while in a crowd.”</p>

<p>“You took the watch yourself, Mr. Markel,” put
in Mark, boldly. “And what is more, you sent for
his valise and robbed that. It is utterly useless for
you to deny it. If there is any officer in this settlement
I shall have you arrested.”</p>

<p>At this the man from Baltimore turned pale. He
started as if to run away, then saw how hopeless
such a move would be and held his ground.</p>

<p>The talk had attracted a crowd, which included
the general manager of the mining settlement, Mr.
John Brisbam. He now demanded to know what it
meant, and, with many interruptions from Markel,
Mark and Frank told of the Hockley affair and of
what had occurred at Macuto.</p>

<p>“We can prove all we say, if you’ll only give us a
little time,” added Mark. “As soon as I can find
my friends again I’ll bring them here. In the meantime
I would like this man placed under arrest.”</p>

<p>“Arrest! Not much!” howled Dan Markel. “It—it’s
an outrage! I am an honest American citizen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
and I demand protection. There is a great mistake.
I am not the person they are after.”</p>

<p>“Do you mind being searched?” asked Andy
Hume, shrewdly.</p>

<p>“You have no right to touch me!” returned the
man from Baltimore in increased alarm.</p>

<p>A war of words, which nearly came to blows followed,
but in the end Dan Markel was marched into
one of the offices of the mining company. Here his
pockets were examined and from one was taken
Hockley’s watch.</p>

<p>“There are Hockley’s initials,” said Mark, pointing
them out. “J. A. H. don’t stand for Daniel
Markel.”</p>

<p>“That’s right they don’t,” came from Andy
Hume. “He’s a black sheep sure as you’re born.
All this money must belong to Hockley, too,” he
added, counting up a quantity of gold and silver
amounting to nearly three hundred dollars. The
balance of the funds had already been squandered by
the man from Baltimore.</p>

<p>Dan Markel raved and even swore at the treatment
he received, and in the end he was handcuffed. The
watch and money were placed in Mr. Brisbam’s
hands for safe keeping, and the prisoner was marched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
to one of the houses and a guard set, in order that
he might not escape.</p>

<p>A little later Mark and Frank set off with the
native boatman for the camp on the Orinoco. It
was already growing dark, but the native knew the
course well, so there was no danger of going astray.</p>

<p>“I see the camp-fire!” cried Frank, when they
were yet half a mile off. “How good it looks!
Almost like home!”</p>

<p>“I feel as if we had been away an age,” returned
Mark. “I can tell you I don’t want to get lost
again.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Mark; the very word is enough
to give one the shivers.”</p>

<p>As they drew closer they set up a loud shout,
which was presently answered by Sam and Darry,
who came rushing down to the water’s edge to receive
them.</p>

<p>“We had almost given you up,” said Darry.
“Where in the world have you been?”</p>

<p>“We’ve been further than we intended to go,”
answered Mark. “Where is the professor and the
others?”</p>

<p>“The professor and Cubara are out looking for
you. Hockley is in the tent. He fell in with a boa-constrictor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
and the snake nearly crushed him to
death.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got news for him—news he’ll be glad to
hear,” said Frank.</p>

<p>All walked up the bluff to the camp-fire and there
each told his story. In the midst of the recitals
Hockley roused up. He could scarcely believe his
ears when listening to what Mark and Frank had to
tell concerning Dan Markel.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you collared him,” he said, faintly.
“I didn’t mind the money so much, but I hated to
part with the watch. What will you do next? I
can’t go over to that mining camp yet. I’m too
sore.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see what the professor says,” said Mark.</p>

<p>The professor and the Indian came in a short
while later. They had been up and down the river
for miles and were thoroughly disheartened. When
Professor Strong saw Frank and Mark he was overjoyed
and could scarcely keep from hugging them.</p>

<p>“I was so afraid you had met your death in the
jungle I knew not what to do,” he said. “I did not
sleep a wink last night. We picked up your trail
twice and lost it. We found the canoe and that led
me to think that perhaps you were drowned.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>“We have had adventures enough to last us a
year,” returned Mark. “I can tell you a life in the
jungle is all well enough to read about, but in
reality it isn’t half so pleasant as one imagines.”</p>

<p>It was arranged that all hands should move to the
mining settlement the next afternoon, starting after
the sun had spent its force for the day. Hockley
was to be made comfortable in Cubara’s recovered
canoe, with the professor to wait on him, while the
other boys made the passage in the craft brought
from Castroville.</p>

<p>The next morning was a busy one, for there were
many things to pack up. Sam, Darry, Mark and
Frank went out for a last hunt, taking Cubara with
them. They brought in several peccaries and a score
of birds, including two beautiful Venezuelan trumpeters,
which they had found wading in a pool half
a mile distant from the Orinoco.</p>

<p>“This ends our outing tour in Venezuela I suppose,”
said Frank. “Well, I am not sorry. We
have still a good deal of ground to cover and we
can’t afford to spend too much time in one place.”</p>

<p>Four o’clock of the next day saw them embarking
at the foot of the bluff. They had carried Hockley
to the canoe and now the disabled youth was placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
on a grassy cushion which would add to the comfort
of the boat ride.</p>

<p>“Good-bye to the camp!” cried Darry, as the
boats left the shore. “More than likely we’ll never
see the place again. Good-bye!” And the others
echoed the words. Soon the turn in the river hid the
locality from their view.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A few words more and we will bring to a close
this story of sight seeing and adventures in Venezuela.</p>

<p>When our friends reached Castroville a surprise
awaited them. Despite the guard which had been
set, Dan Markel had escaped through the night,
stolen one of the small boats on the river, and departed
for parts unknown. A search lasting two
hours had been instituted but had proved of no
avail.</p>

<p>“We followed him down the stream to where there
are several forks,” said Andy Hume. “He took to
one of them, but which one we don’t know.”</p>

<p>“But he didn’t take any of my stuff with him, did
he?” was Hockley’s anxious question.</p>

<p>“No, he escaped with nothing but his clothing and
a pistol he stole from his guard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>“Then let him go,” returned the lank youth. “I
never want to see him again.”</p>

<p>“I think myself it is just as well,” said Professor
Strong. “To prosecute him would put us to a great
deal of trouble. If he hasn’t a cent he will have a
hard enough time of it getting along down here.”</p>

<p>“Right you are,” said Andy Hume. “I’ll wager
he’ll bitterly regret that he ever left the States.”</p>

<p>When Hockley received his things back he wished
to reward Frank and Mark for what they had done,
but the two boys would not listen to this. Then he
said that he was very grateful and hoped that they
should be friends in the future.</p>

<p>“I’ve made up with Darry and Beans,” he said to
Frank and Mark. “And I want to make up with
you, too.”</p>

<p>“All right, it suits me!” answered Frank, readily,
and Mark also agreed, and they shook hands.</p>

<p>There was an empty house in the mining settlement
and this was turned over to our friends temporarily,
and here Hockley rested until he felt once
more like himself. During this time the other boys
made a number of trips up into the mountains, viewing
other mines of lesser importance. Thus several
weeks slipped by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>“All told we’ve had some pretty good times here,”
declared Mark to the other boys, one day. “I hope
we have as good in our future travels.” His wish
was fulfilled, and how will be related in another
volume of this series.</p>

<p>In this tale we will not only meet all of our friends
again, but also Dan Markel and learn something of
what became of the fellow after he left Castroville,
and of how he plotted fresh trouble for those who
had exposed him.</p>

<p>And now for the present let us bid Professor
Strong and our young friends adieu. We have followed
them in an interesting trip from one end of
Venezuela to the other, have visited the capital and
other important cities, and have gone with them up
the Orinoco and into the jungle. Our friends have
had numerous adventures and have been in several
positions of more or less peril. But all has turned
out well, and here we will say good-bye.</p>

<p>“It is such books as ‘Richard Dare’s Venture’ that are calculated to inspire
young readers with a determination to succeed in life, and to choose some honorable
walk in which to find that success. The author, Edward Stratemeyer, has shown a
judgment that is altogether too rare in the makers of books for boys, in that he has
avoided that sort of heroics in the picturing of the life of his hero which deals in
adventures of the daredevil sort. In that respect alone the book commends itself to
the favor of parents who have a regard for the education of their sons, but the story
is sufficiently enlivening and often thrilling to satisfy the healthful desires of the
young reader.”—<i>Kansas City Star.</i></p>

<p>“Of standard writers of boys’ stories there is quite a list, but those who have not
read any by Edward Stratemeyer have missed a very goodly thing.”—<i>Boston Ideas.</i></p>
